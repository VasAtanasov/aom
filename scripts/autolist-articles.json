      "body": "### Pros:  \n\n- A distinctive combination of size and cargo space in the segment  \n- Spacious legroom and headroom for first and second-row passengers  \n- Good array of standard technology features fitting a premium brand  \n\n### Cons:  \n\n- Reviewers have some complaints about the ride quality  \n- Standard safety features are not as plentiful as they could be  \n- Third-row seating is very tight  \n\n### Summary:  \n\nThe 2020 Mercedes GLB is an all-new compact crossover SUV slated to go on sale in the United States in late 2019.  \n\nEven though the SUV market is flooded with choices, the new Mercedes-Benz GLB-Class is relatively unique in that it offers third-row seating for up to seven passengers. It is larger than the small [GLA-Class](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-gla+class) but smaller than the compact [GLC-Class](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-glc+class). Neither the GLA nor the GLC has a third-row option, nor do many other SUVs that aren't midsize or larger.  \n\nIts small size and third-row seating option give the GLB the packaging edge over larger rivals such as the [BMW X3](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-x3), [Audi Q5](https://www.autolist.com/audi-q5), and [Jaguar F-Pace](https://www.autolist.com/jaguar-f+pace). It is also larger its direct rivals like the [Volvo XC40](https://www.autolist.com/volvo-xc40), [BMW X1](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-x1) and the [Audi Q3](https://www.autolist.com/audi-q3). Its combination of size and practicality limits its competition, but the [Volkswagen Tiguan](https://www.autolist.com/volkswagen-tiguan) and [Land Rover Discovery](https://www.autolist.com/land+rover-discovery) are the closest overall.  \n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLB-Class is related to the compact [A-Class](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-a+class#s=a) sedan and [CLA](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-cla+class) four-door. Reviewers note that many A-Class niceties are carried over throughout the GLB, especially in the interior setup and new MBUX infotainment system that can be controlled the way a voice assistant can.  \n\nAnother piece of the GLB that further sets it apart from many other small luxury SUVs is its off-road ability. It is not as capable as the best Land Rover models and does not feature Jeep Wrangler ruggedness, but a small suite of off-road drive settings make it more usable in the great outdoors than many of its closest competition.  \n\nWith so many options in the SUV marketplace, it is hard to imagine that a better one may be out there, but it appears that Mercedes-Benz has come up with one in the GLB that extends boundaries that have previously been set by so many others. \n\n### Exterior:  \n\n*TLDR: It's handsome styling, large wheels, and upright canopy make it look larger than it is.*  \n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLB-Class is boxier and more upright than the GLA, GLC and GLE siblings. Its wheelbase is five inches longer than the GLA, and its overall length is only about an inch and a half shorter than the GLC. \n\n![2020-mercedes-glb-exterior-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4EIOqiKbWqnuG7y4durNPs/41a8aa185f98c8ae4a77a5160f4f49de/2020-mercedes-glb-exterior-image.jpg)\n\nAll of these factors combine to give the GLB a more substantial overall appearance than its dimensions might suggest. Yet there are typical Mercedes-Benz SUV styling cues at the front and rear.\n\n![2020-mercedes-glb-rear-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/28pAekNx3RFTe3EWUo8U0g/ccba5daa3602e086f1db7a152870b0c0/2020-mercedes-glb-rear-image.jpg)\n\nIts side profile strays significantly from the GLA and GLC by featuring an upright canopy, designed to maximize interior space. Large wheels fill out the fenders well, and black trim around the fenders and bottom of the SUV give it the slightly rugged look that hints at its off-road capability.  \n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort: \n\n*TLDR: Interior quality and comfort are good with spacious legroom and headroom for first and second-row passengers. The optional third-row seat is cramped.*  \n\n![2020-mercedes-glb-dashboard-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5M7tl9kdkJJVOiZi0mGfNB/de677a444b813d28b1704ceef890f849/2020-mercedes-glb-dashboard-image.jpg)\n\nAs expected by most reviewers, interior quality and comfort fall in line with where the GLB sits amongst its siblings. Most agree that it is nicer and more comfortable than the GLA-Class but lacks a little when compared to the larger GLC.  \n\n![2020-mercedes-glb-seats-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5QWqoWl4ETk9QcoBDid6rI/67425ca088de38c94a674d879bdb57dc/2020-mercedes-glb-seats-image.jpg)\n\nSeveral reviewers note that the front seats offer more legroom than its overall size would suggest and that the second row is quite comfortable due to its sliding seats. Despite its optional third row, reviewers agree that space is minimal and mostly suited for small children. It should be noted that the second-row seat's sliding ability does provide additional legroom for third-row passengers.  \n\nHeadroom, front-row legroom, and second-row legroom are all noted to be excellent.  \n\nThe interior quality is typical of Mercedes and is reminiscent of the A-Class sedan, as noted by reviewers. Most have no qualms with the layout and note that the materials used are more durable than they are purely luxurious. At its projected price point, reviewers have no issues with this.  \n\n![2020-mercedes-glb-seats2-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1bvSSwnUNToD0ZeNE8jyWR/6e265704498b85dfc05db8a4fb478fb6/2020-mercedes-glb-seats2-image.jpg)\n\nRide quality is better than the smaller GLA due to its longer wheelbase but is still noted to be a bit unruly on rough surfaces, especially given the large wheel option. Optional adaptive suspension should help even out the ride quality, according to reviewers.  \n\n### Utility & Practicality  \n\n*TLDR: Utility and practicality are good with the third-row seat being both a positive and a negative. Some mild off-roading is even possible.*  \n\nUtility and practicality are relatively high due to the GLB's added off-road capability, its boxy dimensions, and optional third row.  \n\n![2020-mercedes-glb-trunk-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1ymuCOpcKgNgMd1Qn9DzDs/6f28595d3244b8631c3d7dd56a604849/2020-mercedes-glb-trunk-image.jpg)\n\nThe GLB is very easy to get in and out of for reviewers of almost any size. Cargo room is ample, with the rear seats folded at 62 cubic feet of space. With the third-row, this drops and back seat practicality decreases significantly.  \n\nStill, having a third-row does add the option of more passenger capability, even if space is limited. Additionally, the third-row can be folded to accommodate additional cargo when necessary.  \n\n![2020-mercedes-glb-profile-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3Minnx7ZZHYcrmmasV7dQp/07a79ae5cd35f46312a85eca1b34f1a0/2020-mercedes-glb-profile-image.jpg)\n\nOverall, reviewers note that the interior is spacious and open. The MBUX infotainment system is easy to use, according to reviewers, and dual infotainment displays make information easy to see. Touchpads on the steering wheel and center console are noted to make functions and information easy to access within the system.  \n\nThe GLB's optional all-wheel-drive system, hill descent control, and hill start assist add a good bit of poor weather driving capability as well as some light off-roading ability. Reviewers note that most GLB buyers will not be cruising the safari or scaling the mountains, but those who seek adventure away from the urban streets can undoubtedly find it quite easily.  \n\n### Technology & Infotainment  \n\n*TLDR: Technology features and an updated MBUX infotainment system make a strong showing.*  \n\nTechnology and infotainment features are on par with what reviewers have come to expect from Mercedes.  \n\n![2020-mercedes-glb-infotainment-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/CHZ8zMToZ2V8HpBxuKsGL/0b25ffb956718cd7fda70bece53b64b2/2020-mercedes-glb-infotainment-image.jpg)\n\nApple CarPlay, Android Auto, and intelligent voice assistant all come standard with the Mercedes User Experience infotainment software. It is displayed through two 7-inch screens with optional larger 10.25-inch displays and is controlled by touchpads on the steering wheel and center console.  \n\nOther reported standard technology includes power front seats, a power liftgate, LED headlights, a rearview camera, USB-C ports, selectable drive modes, and crosswind assist.  \n\nOptional technology features include 4Matic all-wheel-drive, hill-descent control, adaptive suspension, a head-up display, and radar-based semi-autonomous driving features.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Safety & Driving Assistance  \n\n*TLDR: Standard safety features are few, but optional ones are plentiful.*  \n\nAs with many other luxury vehicles, standard safety and driver aids are fewer than expected, but optional equipment is plentiful.  \n\nStandard safety features include forward-collision warning and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection. Optional safety features include adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert with automatic emergency braking, forward cross-traffic alert, and lane-keeping assist.  \n\nAt the time of writing, neither the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety have crash-tested and rated the GLB-Class.  \n\n### Driving Experience  \n\n*TLDR: The driving experience is adequate, with a rough ride over rough roads and decent performance from the engine and transmission.*  \n\nMost reviewers have not had the chance to drive the new Mercedes-Benz GLB-Class, but many have been allowed to experience the compact SUV from the passenger seat. Many have not been blown away by the performance or ride quality the GLB has to offer, but most agree that the GLB is an agreeable all-around SUV, and the total package delivers what it needs to to make the GLB a success.  \n\nThe 2020 GLB-Class offers only one engine option. A 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine will be the first and only engine option available. It produces 221 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The single transmission available comes in the form of an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic.  \n\nDespite being offered with only one engine and transmission option, the GLB comes standard with front-wheel-drive. The 4Matic all-wheel-drive drivetrain is optional and is anticipated to be around $2,000 extra if other Mercedes Benz vehicles are indicative of price forecasting.  \n\nFrom the passenger seats, reviewers note that the GLB's powertrain is smooth, consistent, and does not have to work that hard to get going. Most agree that the dual-clutch automatic works well and that it does not search for gears like some larger SUVs that lack power.  \n\nOfficial 0-60 mph times have not yet been released, but Mercedes-Benz claims a time of just under seven seconds for all-wheel-drive models. If it holds, this is a quick time compared to its closest competitors.  \n\nReviewers note that the ride quality leaves a little to be desired. Without the adaptive suspension, many note the ride to be slightly fidgety and rough, even on the highway. Many attribute this to the large wheels and run-flat tires, but most anticipate a slightly better experience with adaptive suspension equipped. Cabin noise is kept to a minimum, according to testers, and the comfortable seats help with the overall ride quality.  \n\nOverall, reviewers are pleased, though not blown away by the GLB's powertrain, comfort levels, and all-around driving experience. Most agree that \"adequate\" is a good way to describe their first riding impressions of the newest Mercedes model.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n\n### Fuel efficiency  \n\n*TLDR: Fuel economy numbers have not yet been released, but based on similar models, it should be par for the class.*  \n\nFuel economy numbers have not yet been released for the new GLB, but both the GLA and GLC use the same 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, and figures should hover around what is currently on the market.  \n\nThe 2019 GLA 250 returns a combined EPA estimate of 27 mpg when equipped with front-wheel-drive and 26 miles per gallon with all-wheel-drive, with its 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder. The 2019 GLC 300 returns a combined EPA estimate of 24 mpg whether or not it is equipped with all-wheel-drive.  \n\nThe GLB is closer in size to the GLC than it is to the GLA, but EPA estimates should still fall between the two models.  \n\nThe 2020 [Land Rover Discovery Sport](https://www.autolist.com/land+rover-discovery+sport) falls well short of both the current GLA and GLC fuel economy estimates at 21 mpg combined. The 2020 [BMW X1](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-x1) models carry EPA estimates nearly identical to the GLA while the [Audi Q3](https://www.autolist.com/audi-q3) returns numbers much closer to the Land Rover.  \n\n#### Trim Levels & Pricing  \n\n*TLDR: A front-wheel-drive and 4Matic all-wheel-drive system differentiates the two trim levels with ample package options for all the customization you might want at a reasonable price.*  \n\nAll GLB models come with a single engine option: A 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 221 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque.  \n\nFront-wheel drive is standard on GLB 250 models while adding all-wheel-drive takes buyers to the GLB 250 4Matic trim. Both drivetrains are mated to an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.  \n\nThe 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLB-Class will be offered in two trim levels. \n\n__Mercedes Benz GLB250:__  \n\nThe GLB 250 will start at a $36,600 MSRP with a $995 destination fee.  \n\nStandard equipment includes 18-inch aluminum wheels, leatherette upholstery, MBUX infotainment system with dual 7-inch displays, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, HD radio, leather-wrapped steering wheel, front memory seats, remote start, power front seats, and a power liftgate.  \n\nStandard safety features include a backup camera, brake assist, automatic emergency braking, traction control, and forward-collision warning.  \n\nOptional equipment includes leather upholstery, sunroof, a hands-free liftgate, heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats, a navigation system, satellite radio, 10.25-inch infotainment screens, a head-up display, adaptive suspension, and third-row seating.  \n\n__Mercedes Benz GLB 250 4Matic:__  \n\nThe GLB 250 4Matic starts at $38,600 with a $995 destination fee. The only real difference between the two trims is the 4Matic all-wheel-drive system and the Off-Road Engineering package that comes with it. It adds additional drive modes with hill-descent and start control, along with off-road driving assists, which appear in the information screens.  \n\nAll other standard and optional features from the GLB 250 remain the same.  \n\nIn addition to the optional features from both trims, a variety of package options are available for GLB models.  \n\nThe Driver Assistance Package includes safety technologies such as adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assist, lane departure warning, steering assist, and rear cross-traffic alert with emergency braking.  \n\nThe Parking Assist Package includes a 360-degree top-down camera and an advanced parking assist system. Adding the Exterior Lighting package adds active LED headlights and adaptive high beams.  \n\nThe Multimedia Package includes navigation and several add-ons such as road sign assistance and over-the-air map updating.  \n\nThe Night Package is essentially an appearance package and includes blacked-out trim pieces such as the front splitter, mirror housings, and roof rails.  \n\nThe Premium Package includes power-folding mirrors, auto-dimming rearview mirror, upgraded 10.25-inch digital display, and upgraded 10.25-inch touchscreen media display.  \n\n### Value  \n\n*TLDR: The GLB offers a good combination of size, practicality, and capability starting at the price of an average new vehicle.*  \n\nThe 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLB-Class is another compact luxury SUV on the market. Yet, it is different than the rest because of its unique combination of size, seating capacity, and capability. Mercedes has carved a niche in the segment that has not existed until now.  \n\nIts base price of just under $37,000 should be appealing to consumers because it is about the average cost of a new car in the current market. For a premium brand and an SUV that can do just about everything at its size is quite remarkable.  \n\nDespite being quite small, the third-row seating option offers the ability to squeeze in some extra passengers in a pinch. Additionally, the GLB 250 4Matic provides a good amount of off-road capability for a small luxury SUV.  \n\nIts host of standard technology features and infotainment offerings is good at its price point though some of the more common standard safety features are lacking compared to other vehicles. A long list of optional features and additional safety features add to the base price, but more than make up for anything that may be lacking.  \n\nFuel economy numbers have not been released yet, but based on current models, they should be among the top contenders in the class.  \n\nComfort, interior space, and cargo capacity are all good thanks to the GLB's upright canopy and sliding second-row seats, even though ride comfort takes a hit. Many reviewers note that it can get choppy on rough and uneven surfaces without the adaptive suspension option.  \n\nOverall, the new GLB-Class offers reasonable value at its price point, but reviewers note that it won't give you the most premium experience Mercedes-Benz has to offer.\n\n### More Photos\n\nSee more [2020 Mercedes GLB Photos](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes-benz/2020-mercedes-glb-photos).\n",

      "body": "The simplest way to purchase a new car post-bankruptcy is to pay cash for the vehicle. For most people, this option is only available for inexpensive used cars. And for many, purchasing any vehicle requires at least some financing. \n\nPutting your credit score back together after bankruptcy takes time and hard work. Whether you had to declare Chapter 7 bankruptcy or Chapter 13 bankruptcy, it is still possible to purchase a car. This article discusses how buying a car after bankruptcy can help you get a fresh start with your credit rating.\n\n### Filing Bankruptcy and Your Credit Report\n\nFew financial situations damage your credit score like a bankruptcy. Bad credit makes financing a car more difficult. Before purchasing a car after bankruptcy, it is essential to wait until the bankruptcy is either the court has discharged your previous debts or the bankruptcy is closed. Not all debts qualify for a bankruptcy discharge, such as student loans. A new auto lender will consider all of your existing debt payments when deciding whether to issue new credit.\n\nBoth Chapter 7 and 13 bankruptcies have long term effects on your credit. A chapter 7 bankruptcy remains on your credit report for 10 years. Chapter 13 bankruptcies stay for seven years. \n\nOn a positive note, a post-bankruptcy auto loan can be a vital step to establishing a good credit history. Successful repayment of the loan will make it easier to finance other items in the future or to qualify for a credit card. After a few years of consistent on-time payments, you also may be able to refinance your car with a lower interest rate.\n\n### How Bankruptcy Affects Vehicle Financing\n\nCar dealerships, banks, credit unions and other lenders require borrowers with a prior bankruptcy to provide more security than borrowers with good credit. That is because they view these borrowers as a higher risk of default. The additional security generally begins with a larger down payment. Next, expect the car loan to have a higher interest rate. Lastly, the term of the loan may be shorter than traditional loans. A shorter term and higher interest rate result in a higher monthly payment. It also raises the total loan amount once interest is included.\n\nIn addition to a higher interest rate, financial institutions may include other requirements for borrowers with a prior bankruptcy filing. For example, lenders may require one or more cosigners. A cosigner is someone, often a family member, who agrees to pay off the loan if the original lender does not make the required loan payments. For lenders, having a cosigner makes default on the loan less likely. It also decreases the likelihood of repossession. For borrowers with poor credit, a cosigner with good credit can result in a better loan rate and more favorable loan terms for their car purchase.\n\n### Improving Your Credit Before Shopping for a Car\n\nOne of the best ways to improve the loan terms when buying a car is to improve your credit score. Most lenders rely on your FICO score, along with your employment income, to determine interest rates and loan amounts. After bankruptcy, raising your credit score can be slow. However, establishing a good credit history with an unsecured or secured credit card helps show lenders your trustworthiness. A good credit history means making all payments on time, along with regular, but not excess, use of your credit. Even six months of on-time payments can raise your credit score and help lower the interest rate on future loans. For most post-bankruptcy borrowers, credit card interest rates are high. However, paying off the full amount of credit used each month allows you to build your credit score without paying interest.\n\nWhether or not you attempt to improve your credit score, before shopping for a car, try to get pre-approval for an auto loan. Pre-approval allows you to shop with a specific budget and also helps you avoid dealing with predatory lenders or dealers. \n\nWhen looking for financing, you should start with lenders that are familiar with the positive aspects of your credit history. That can include your bank or credit union. It is especially true if you have a long-standing relationship with these institutions. Lenders who you have a relationship with will be more likely to listen to the circumstances surrounding your bankruptcy. If relevant, provide documents that show your bankruptcy was caused by a major event, such as a medical emergency or loss of employment.\n\nProvide records of your prior on-time payments and how your circumstances have changed since your bankruptcy, such as a higher paying job. The bank or credit union that you direct deposit your paycheck with can quickly verify your employment. If you had a credit card that was paid off and remained open after your bankruptcy, the lender is another potential starting point. After you exhaust those options, then look to the subprime loan market, but proceed with caution.\n\n### Predatory Lenders and Dealerships\n\nSome lenders offer subprime loans to borrowers with poor credit or bankruptcy history. These lenders often work hand-in-hand with used vehicle dealerships. Alternately, dealerships offer installment repayment plans financed directly through the dealer. For some borrowers, these are the only financing options. However, they often come with a higher risk to the borrower, in addition to high interest rates. For example, many installment plans from dealers have stricter policies regarding late or missed payments than other financial institutions. That can lead to more frequent repossession than for other financed vehicles.\n\nMost of these types of lenders charge higher interest rates or have other unfavorable terms. Some used car dealers also take advantage of bad credit borrowers by only offering to finance low-quality cars. Such dealers prey on frustrated buyers who cannot qualify for other financing arrangements.\n\n### Shopping for a Car\n\nBeing realistic about what you can afford is essential, no matter which type of lender you use. Before looking for a car, determine how much you can afford each month, and do not agree to a monthly payment that exceeds that amount. It is also a good idea to check your credit score before applying for a loan. Also, bear in mind that applying for credit with too many lenders can harm your credit score.\n\nBefore applying for financing at a bank or dealer, it is best to discuss your specific situation. Most lenders can estimate whether you will qualify for a loan without running your credit if you know your credit score and history. Only apply when it is likely your application will be approved.\n\nIf you cannot find approval, it may be best to wait a few months. It may allow you to save for a larger down payment, or to make a few more on-time payments on a credit card. If waiting is not an option and you need a car immediately, expect to pay more at a self-financing dealer or subprime lender. Regardless, it is best to shop around to find the best vehicle available for your financial situation. \n\n### Summary\n\nBuying a car after bankruptcy typically means paying cash or financing with higher interest rates and less than favorable loan terms. Buyers may also need a cosigner and may be targeted by predatory lenders. Rebuilding credit and receiving pre-approval for an auto loan can make car buying less stressful and result in a better rate for borrowers with a bankruptcy history.",

      "body": "### How to Negotiate a Car Price When Paying Cash\n\nAnyone who needs to buy a new or used car dreads the process and negotiations. It seems the moment a customer pulls into the car lot, throngs of salespeople descend on them, hardly letting them get out of their vehicle. Car buying at a dealership makes for an often confusing and frustrating transaction. Usually, car buyers leave the dealership without a new car or drive away in a new vehicle they know they paid too much. However, if you pay cash upfront for your purchase, you have more bargaining power from the get-go. \n\n### Do Your Homework Before You Go\n\nBefore heading out to shop for a car, do some homework first. Decide what whether you want a used vehicle or new, what options are essential, color choices, gas economy, two or four-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive, and do online searches so you know what kind of details you should jot down. Knowing what type of vehicle you need to buy and what options you need prepares you to start searching dealership lots.\n\n### Get Your Negotiator Hat On\n\nHow you present yourself at the car dealership makes a difference. First, call and schedule an actual appointment to meet with car salespeople. Too many times, a car buyer gets caught up in the sales hype, as well as add-ons dealers stick on such as paint protectors or even exterior wraps. Making an appointment gives you time to arrive at the showroom with your information and negotiator hat on, leading to an air of confidence. And that makes a car salesman nervous.\n\nPart of your homework needs to research price ranges and markups for the type of car you want to buy. Used or new isn't as important as having a printout with you of the current market value from an auto website like Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book, or NADA. Run some prices on a vehicle with different options, mileage, and engine size and print out the average retail price, average trade-in price, and high retail price. When it comes to the back and forth price game, you already know what you'll settle for. And remember, keep all your information under your hat. Don't let on that you did your homework. That only makes the negotiations tougher.\n\n### Load Your Trojan Horse and Save the Good Stuff for the Battle\n\nOnce you have stacks of paper with all your notes and numbers, place them in a folder, separated in categories. If you can, keep this folder off the desk. Don't open it until you're ready to let the most aggressive negotiation begin. If you give the salesman too much information at first, they will move quickly to hardcore sales tactics. Your goal is to be cool, calm, and collected.\n\nIf you plan to use your current car as a trade-in, do not reveal this to the salesman until the right timing. Let them roll out the asking price and potential discounts or incentives that apply to customers like you. Dealers will finagle the profit margin on the sales price to appear they're giving you a lot of money for your trade-in. When the price is right and time is right, and you decided you want the car, let them know you changed your mind and will trade-in your vehicle.\n\nThe final tip here is don't let the sales associates know you'll be paying cash until right before you accept their offer. Let them know that you'd like to find a car and agree on a price first. Then maybe you will talk about financing with them later. Typically, the salesperson will think you didn't get funding before coming into the dealership, and the sales staff will assume they can sell you on in-house financing. Car buyers who must use financing to buy a car should always get approved by a third-party bank or credit union before they head to the dealership, especially one where you already have a long-standing relationship.\n\n### Play Your Cards Right\n\nIf you get to the place where you decided on a car, and you find yourself face-to-face with the king or queen of price haggling, be sure you're ready to play your cards right. Think of your negotiations as your cards; you have the car you want with the options and color, you know you won't need financing or an auto loan, so that card is a keeper, but you're not sure of the last few cards.\n\nDealerships typically present cars by offering a monthly payment price—not the actual purchase price. If you ask for a lower payment, they will provide a lower price, but the real cost of the car just went up. A lower monthly payment doesn't mean a lower price. Make them reveal the actual list price of the vehicle.\n\nThen, have them print an estimate sheet with the actual car price and have them include all sales tax, fees, registration costs, and any other amounts to give you the final price with everything included. With that card in hand, you are well prepared to negotiate a lower price. The salesman should be a bit worn at this point from all the ways you've dodged their haggling. But they will come back with a second wind.\n\n### Come Up from the Rear for the Win\n\nBegin your offers with a price you already planned as the lowest. Somehow, use your phone, tablet, or pen and paper, take the MSRP, deduct the incentives, and that will give you a starting price. Always begin with the lowest.\n\nWith all your information and numbers in front of you, plan answers to the next decision: the financing options. It is the best time to come up from the rear and start going back and forth on price. The salesman thinks he has you convinced and you want the car. They already know they can make more money on the sale by offering you their in-house financing. They see the finish line in sight and feel confident the deal is a good as done.\n\nLet them ask you about financing and then drop the 'cash card' on them. Once you let the sales staff know you will be buying the car outright for cash, you can offer reasons why the car price can be lower. Are there any rebates? Will they throw in an extended warranty? After all, you're paying cash, which is a fast deal for the salesman and less paperwork and preparation. Salespeople make a profit off selling you a car in three ways; selling the vehicle, setting up financing with their banks, and making money on your trade-in when they resell it. So a cash transaction cuts down their profit.\n\nNow you're in the prime position to take control of the negotiations. Here, you can push to ask for other niceties such as free maintenance, floor mats and other minor accessories that could've added hundreds of dollars to the purchase price. The salesperson will likely shy away from giving in to perks that may cost him more in the end. That puts you in a better position to negotiate your very bottom price.\n\n### Dig Your Heels in for Final Lap\n\nEven racecar drivers know they have to conserve fuel to get to the finish line, checkered flag waving them into victory. The final terms of the deal are being settled, but it's still important to remain calm and steady. Don't get emotional, stand firm, and never let on that you know you're winning. The price tags on the cars in the lot are seldom the actual price. Buying a brand new microwave in a department store is typically non-negotiable, but you're talking about spending thousands of dollars on a car you want to last you a long time. So negotiate as long as you can. The dealer doesn't want to lose your sale, and the salesperson knows that.\n\nThat person isn't merely trying to get the best price for the dealership. They want to make the highest profit for the dealership, which in turn affects their commission. Once they turn down the extras you asked for free, and now that you're trying to lower the price of the car, they will resurrect the 'sell-ups' like roadside assistance plans, additional and extended warranties, and other enhancements like seat covers and new mats. Don't do it. Keep your heels dug in.\n\nSo the price negotiations continue. The salesperson now points out the deal he's offering is so much lower than the sticker price that the dealer will lose money. That, of course, is not true. They just threw a curveball hoping you'd have no idea what the actual sticker price is, and you now feel bad that you keep trying to get the cost of the car even lower. Know your terminology. MSRP stands for Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price, a number decided by the actual manufacturer that has nothing to do with the current value of the car on the lot or how much your car purchase will ultimately cost.\n\n### Bring It All In for a Landing\n\nThe negotiation process when buying a car can be daunting. First, there's the test drive. You've talked additional options and sticker price, financing and watched the salesperson run back and forth to the dealer's office to present your offers. It's the dealer who ultimately has the power to accept or reject your offer. But they aren't just talking about numbers in the office. The conversation is likely about how the salesman can use intimidating tactics to get you to agree to the price they want. Typically, the dealer has a large glass window so you can see the back and forth pleading between the salesperson and sales manager. \n\nThere are a few little tips to keep the landing smooth. Mention you have bids from competing dealers even if you don't just to perk the salesperson's curiosity. When they ask you to show the bids to them, you can simply say you didn't bring them but have the numbers in mind. Or, if you did obtain any quotes before going to this dealership, asked the salesperson to beat the price. It will only help if the previous dealer offered a bid on a similar car with comparable options and mileage.\n\nBe patient and polite. An excellent ending to negotiations when buying a car, especially for cash, consists of purchasing the vehicle for at or only a small amount above your bottom figure. Remember, the salesperson does this back and forth price game all day and likely has been for years. It's expected, but you were ready.\n\n### Touchdown\n\nKeep your expectations real as the price you want to pay for the car may be too far out of the dealership's bottom line or lowest price. If you can successfully negotiate a price you have enough cash for plus or minus a small amount you know you can afford, take it. Being too uncompromising could ruin the deal, and you'll have to find another car you like, at another dealership, with another salesman, an exhausting process.\n\nBuying a car for cash and being able to haggle with the invoice price and complete the deal is not for the faint of heart. Think of it as a challenge and practice before you go. It might consist of either play-acting in the mirror or with a friend. If you're anxious about the prospect of a battle of the wits, enlist the help of a friend or family member to accompany you. Be sure they are informed about all your research and you can trust them to handle the haggling the way you would. And don't overlook private seller deals. Going with a private party sale can mean getting a better price.\n\nBottom line: money talks, and it always will. When you have all the cash you need to pay for your vehicle purchase, you can negotiate for better deals. Have a strategy worked out going into the sale, and you can get the best price possible on your next new or used car.",

      "body": "If you are in the market to finance a new or used car, then you may be asking yourself how much money to put down. A decent down payment can lower your overall purchase price, interest rate and the monthly payment on your next car.\n\nHow much down payment you need depends on several factors. Here is more information about financing your car and determining how much down payment you should have for that next car purchase.\n\n### Reasons Why You Need a Down Payment\n\nYou may have seen those commercials that advertise auto loans with no money down, but those offers often have strings attached, and they're not for everyone. Here are some reasons why it is financially prudent to put money down when you finance your car with a car loan.\n\n__You Guard Against Depreciation__\n\nBy putting even a small amount towards your purchase, you will reduce the chance that you will be upside down in your loan. New cars depreciate a great deal in the first year after the sale. If you happen to wreck your new car, or you need to sell it quickly soon after you bought it, then a down payment will reduce the amount you owe on your loan or have to pay back to the loan company.\n\n__You Look  Better to the Finance Company__\n\nWhen you pay any money upfront for your car, you show the lender that you are less financially risky. If you have a low credit score or no credit history, a more substantial down payment can increase the lender's faith in you. The lender will feel that they are more likely to get their money back if something happens to the car. Putting money down makes you appear serious about your financial responsibility and commitment to the loan.\n\n__You Will Have a Lower Payment__\n\nAny amount that you put down towards the price of the car will lower your payment compared to if you put no money down. If you plan to finance your car over a long period, then a lower payment will come in handy if your money situation gets tight. You will be more likely to be able to make payments until your situation improves.\n\nIf your monthly payments are low enough, then some lenders may let you pay ahead or double up on them when you are doing well financially. It not only shortens your overall finance term but also decreases the total interest you pay in some cases. You may also be able to lower your car insurance costs by paying off the loan early.\n\n__You May Get a Lower Interest Rate__\n\nDepending on your credit rating, you may get a very favorable interest rate if you put money down. Many finance companies consider the amount you put down when calculating their rates. If you finance through the dealer, a larger down payment may qualify you for special deals and promotional programs such as a rebate or lower price.\n\n### Tips For Building Up a Car Down Payment\n\nWhile many car finance companies suggest that you put at least 20% down on your car, that amount is not ideal for everyone. Here are some tips for saving money on your car loans and building up a down payment.\n\n__Determine Your Budget__\n\nTo help you determine how much you should put down for your car, first, decide how much car and how much loan you can afford. These two things go hand in hand. The more down payment you can afford to put down, the less you will need to be financed. You may wish to buy a used vehicle, or a less expensive new vehicle model, so that you can put a higher amount down.\n\n__Shop Around for Car Loans__\n\nWhen calculating how much you need to put down for your car, take a look at what different lenders require and offer. Some ask for a minimum payment size and a specific loan term. In some cases, you can be subject to a penalty if you pay off your loan early. You may find a big difference in interest rates and terms between banks, credit unions, and dealerships.\n\n__Set Up a Special Savings Account__\n\nOne way you can build up your down payment is to make a separate savings account for your down payment. Put away the amount of money each month that you think your car payment should be. Not only will this help you determine how big a payment you can make, but it will also help you become accustomed to making that payment. \n\n__Consider a Lower Price Vehicle__\n\nIf you are set on a particular make and model, but you think that you can't afford a decent down payment, then consider buying an older, used car. Also, unless you are incredibly loyal to a particular brand, check out similar vehicles in different makes and models. If you don't mind switching brands, then you may get more for your money with a different make. Plus, you may be able to make a larger down payment.\n\n__Use Your Trade-In__\n\nAnother way to add to your down payment is by trading in your old car. However, just like searching for a suitable loan, do your research to see how much you can get for your vehicle. Most dealerships give you the minimum Blue Book value for a car in average condition. You may be able to get more by selling the vehicle yourself and using the cash as part of the down payment.\n\n### A Large Down Payment Isn't Always Ideal\n\nIn general, a larger down payment is better. However, this is not always the case. Many finance companies have a minimum amount that they will loan. That amount varies between lenders, but often the minimum amount usually ranges from $5,000 to $10,000. So if you are planning to buy a $15,000 car and want to put down $12,000, then your lender may require you to put down less money.\n\nThe reason why banks don't like to loan less than a certain amount is that they may feel that the loan is more trouble than what they will get back in interest. In other words, they don't think they can make a profit from a minimal loan. In cases like this, you can find another car for less money and pay for the whole thing in cash, or you can put the extra money back into your savings and finance the minimum amount.\n\n### Down Payments on Leased Cars\n\nThe difference between purchasing a car and leasing is that you typically turn in the vehicle at the end of the term. However, even though you aren't technically buying the car, you can still make a down payment on a lease. When you put a down payment on a lease contract, you are lowering your monthly payment, but that doesn't save you interest like you would with a car loan. One of the significant downsides of this is that you lose any money you put upfront if your car gets stolen or totaled.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you are purchasing either a used or new car, a down payment is beneficial, even if it is small. Strive to accumulate as big a down payment as you can reasonably afford and get the smallest loan possible when purchasing. However, down payments on leases are not always the best idea. Therefore, whether you buy or lease, look into your long-term costs to determine which ways you can save the most.",

      "body": "If you've just moved to the state of Florida, you're probably wondering how to register a car there. When you move and intend to become a resident, you have 30 days to register your out-of-state vehicle with the Florida DMV. To do that, you need to fill a few requirements of becoming a resident.\n\n### What is Considered Florida Residency?\n\nIf you enroll your child in Florida public schools, if you are officially employed in Florida, or if you have a Florida living address through rental, lease or purchase, then you are considered a Florida resident. You are not considered a Florida resident if you've simply come to visit, even if you stay for several weeks.\n\n### What Documents Are Needed to Register a Motor Vehicle in Florida?\n\nAs with any other state, you'll need to bring all of your previous documents to the DMV. That will include your Florida license, vehicle registration, proof of car insurance, current license plate and certificate of title. Using these documents, the DMV will transfer your out of state car to Florida.\n\n### Vehicle Identification Number in Florida\n\nTo complete a Florida vehicle transfer, you will need to have your VIN physically inspected by either a law enforcement officer or a licensed car dealer in the state of Florida. If you have it verified by an out of state dealer, then you will need to have the verification confirmed via letterhead stationery from the dealer. \n\n### Full List of Parties Who Can Inspect Your Vehicle Identification Number\n\nYou can expedite the car registration process by completing a VIN inspection in advance. The following are some parties who are legally allowed to verify your VIN:\n\n- County tax collector's office\n- Any police officer\n- Any licensed Florida car dealership\n- Previous state's car dealer with dealership letterhead\n- Florida DMV inspectors\n- Florida Notary Public\n- An active duty military officer\n\n### Step By Step Vehicle Registration in Florida\n\n- __Step 1__ - Visit a Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles office (DHSMV)\n- __Step 2__ - Have your title and ID with you and show proof of Florida insurance.\n- __Step 3__ - If you haven't done it yet, have a VIN inspection and odometer reading done on site.\n- __Step 4__ - Pay the initial vehicle registration fee of $225, plus taxes, plate and title fees.\n\n### Additional Steps for Out of State Vehicles\n\nBefore you can register your vehicle with the steps indicated previously, you will need to obtain a Florida driver's license and buy Florida auto insurance from an insurance company. If you don't physically have your out of state title due to it being held by a lienholder, then you will have to contact the tax collector's office to have the lienholder send the title.\n\n### Vehicle Sales Tax for New Residents\n\nYou may be charged sales tax, use tax or discretionary local taxes on your vehicle by the state of Florida when you first register it. Whether these taxes are assessed or not depends on the length of time that you have owned your vehicle. If you've owned it for less than six months, then you can expect to be responsible for a six percent state sales or use tax and any required local taxes. The Florida tax will be pro-rated based on your previous state's taxes. For example, if you already paid four percent tax in your home state, then you will owe two percent tax for Florida.\n\nIf you've owned your vehicle for over six months, then you won't have to pay any of the above taxes. However, your vehicle documents will need to verify to the Florida DHSMV that you have owned your vehicle for over six months.\n\n### Car Dealer Registration\n\nIf you buy a car in Florida from a car dealership, you can get a temporary license plate and they will file the registration on your behalf. The dealer must transfer the title and registration within 30 days. You will also need to complete a bill of sale with the seller to have proof of the transaction. That action is essential to have in case the dealer does not transfer the title within the indicated time. At that point, you will have to visit the county tax collector's office to complete the process.\n\n### Buying a Vehicle in Florida as a Non-Resident\n\nIf you come to Florida and buy a new car or used car, but you are not a resident, then you will likely have to get temporary registration tags. Do this by visiting the county tax collector's office and showing proof of insurance. You also need to pay Florida sales tax on the vehicle. These tags allow you to drive it back to your home state.\n\n### Florida Military Vehicle Registration\n\nIf you're a military resident, then you follow the same steps as a Florida resident to register your vehicle. The main difference is that you won't have to pay the initial registration fee. To be exempt, you will have to fill out a Military Initial Registration Fee Exemption Affidavit.\n\nIf you are a non-resident military member who is only stationed in Florida, then you do not have to register your car in Florida. Maintain current registration in your home state and always carry proper proof of insurance. If you do want to register your vehicle in Florida, then you will have to complete the steps listed above and file the exemption to avoid the fee.\n\nSimilarly, if you are a Florida resident stationed out of state, you can continue to maintain your current Florida registration.

      "body": "Autolist rating: __4/5__\nBut would we buy it? __Probably__\nPrice range: __$34,000 - $36,000__, before options but including destination\n \n---\n \n## Key takeaways:\n- The smallest and cheapest sedan in Mercedes’ lineup.\n- Similar to Mercedes' CLA four-door coupe, but this A220 is more modern as it’s built on Mercedes’ latest small-vehicle platform. \n- Provides great pep and handling, for both daily driving and canyon carving. \n- Truck is surprisingly spacious considering the size of the car. \n- Options can quickly push the sticker price too high. \n\n---\n \n\n![F8A1325](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7lUIEZQMCmISIahp5heWh2/3b6ceab9c048454ab00b03996e614a95/_F8A1325.jpg)\n \n \n## What is it?\nThe Mercedes-Benz A220 is a new compact luxury sedan from Mercedes. It’s sold alongside the brand’s CLA four-door coupe, which runs a few thousand dollars more and is currently using a previous-generation platform and interior. \n\nThe Mercedes-Benz A-Class is all-new, and new to the U.S. market, though it’s been around in other markets (as a hatchback) for years. \n\nThis entry-level sedan comes with a 2.0-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder engine that makes 188 horsepower and 221 pound-feet of torque. The base model we tested is front-wheel-drive, while the all-wheel-drive 4Matic model will run you another $2,000. Both versions use a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission with paddle shifters. \n\nSoon a performance-oriented A35 AMG version will be available, which will offer 302 horsepower from a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, plus standard all-wheel-drive. Budget at least $45,000 when this model hits the US market. \n\nMercedes is also expected to release an even hotter A-Class sedan, dubbed the A45, that should pack over 400 horsepower and all-wheel-drive. \n\nTurning back to the A220, it’s aimed at fellow entry-level luxe sedans like the Audi A3, BMW’s upcoming 2-Series four-door coupe, and Acura ILX. The A220 sits at the bottom of Mercedes’ sedan lineup, which includes the aforementioned CLA, C-Class, E-Class, CLS, S-Class, and Mercedes-AMG GT four-door coupe. \n\n\n \n---\n \n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n \n \n## What’s good?\n\n*TLDR: Peppy, good-looking, and full of luxury.*\n \n__Handsome:__ It’s not always easy to make a small vehicle look as handsome as the larger ones in a brand’s lineup. So give Mercedes a heap of credit for being able to make the A-Class sedan just as stylish as anything else the brand sells. This also help make it look more upscale and expensive than it really is; though it may be the cheapest car wearing a tri-star emblem, no one told the A-Class that. \n \n\n![A220Seattle Shaffer 2018 040](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/01aG3GrX2Xr2K4As7jOZsv/5c0fa55889277934a56158787cca8622/A220Seattle_Shaffer_2018_040.jpg)\n\n\n__Actual luxury:__  Though our base tester had thousands of dollars of options added to it, buyers don’t have to spring for the loaded version to feel like they’re in a luxury car. The base base version -- without any options -- still comes with basically everything you’d want in a luxury vehicle (our biggest gripe was the lack of heated seats). \n \n__Plenty of Go:__ We were continuously impressed with the pep the A220 has. Many turbocharged, four-cylinder vehicles (mostly from the German brands) have traditionally suffered from turbo lag and have missed that feeling of true acceleration power. Not this Mercedes; the torque and horsepower are more than enough -- even from a dead stop -- to get the car moving quick. \n \n---\n \n## What’s bad?\n*TLDR: Options get pricey, rear seat is tight, handling could be sharper. *\n \n__Options add up:__ We would have been plenty happy with the base A220 at $34,000. But our tester’s $45,000 sticker was a little too rich for our blood. While some of the ad-ons were nice (an $850 Burmester sound system was a bargain), others didn’t seem worth it (like the $2,310 AMG styling kit or the $1,440 uptick for leather seats). Still others should have been standard in the first place (heated front seats for $580? A garage door opener for $280?). \n\n![A220Seattle Shaffer 2018 048](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/16hXcDFknMhELuqTP7Osv6/647dbd5400a7164d0c1daa345bf043cf/A220Seattle_Shaffer_2018_048.jpg) \n\n \n__Tight rear seat:__  This should come as no surprise given the car’s small size, but we were hoping for a little more room in the rear seat. Certainly not a dealbreaker by any means, but if you’re regularly shuttling around tall people in the back seat, this might not be the car for you. \n\n__Handling quibbles:__  While we were generally impressed with the eagerness of the A220 in daily driving, at times its dynamic character could be a bit vague -- steering and handling and whatnot. But we’re willing to forgive this since the front-wheel-drive A220 isn’t meant to be a performance sedan. \n \n---\n \n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n \n \n## 5 stars of execution\n \nSafety Features? __NO__\n\n- The A220 comes standard with your usual run of standard safety equipment but it lacks as standard gear the kinds of active safety features that you’d hope to see on any vehicle in 2020 -- much less a luxury model that starts around $34,000.\n- The one exception to this is the inclusion of pre-collision automatic emergency braking.\n- Drivers who relish active safety should consider the $2,250 Driver Assistance Package. It adds a thorough suite of features that includes radar cruise control, active steering, evasive steering assist, automatic emergency braking with a cross-traffic function, lane-change assist, and blind-spot assist. \n\n\nValue? __YES-ish__\n\n- Lack of standard and active safety features notwithstanding, Mercedes does pack a lot of value into the A220. Standard gear includes faux-leather seats, seven-inch screens for the instrument panel and the dashboard, a panoramic roof, LED headlights and taillights, a touchpad to control the infotainment system, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and Bluetooth connectivity, dual-zone climate control, and 17-inch alloy wheels.\n- This means buyers can opt for a base A220 and still feel like they got more for their money than just the Mercedes emblem. \n\n\nEfficiency? __YES__\n\n- The front-wheel-drive A220 that we tested is rated by the EPA at 24/35/28 MPG city/highway/combined. \n- That’s about on par with other cars in its segment, including the BMW 2 Series and the Acura ILX; however, Audi’s A3 manages better fuel economy on the FWD model. \n- We averaged about 27 mpg in our week of testing in mixed city and highway driving. \n\n\n![A220Seattle Shaffer 2018 119](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5Rdaw6xaOaiUdfKFwCiW99/be93d847e27a8c8e94701c9cb8010fc4/A220Seattle_Shaffer_2018_119.jpg)\n\nDriving experience? __YES__\n\n-   We were pleasantly surprised by how quick the A220 was, thanks to its turbo engine.\n- There was no meaningful turbo lag during hard acceleration or pulling away on the freeway.\n- The A220 is a savvy blend of everyday driveability and just enough scoot and excitement to keep you interested. \n\nExecution? __YES__\n\n- The A220 is a welcome addition to the world of small luxury sedans. It gives buyers all the style, comfort and features of larger luxury cars and SUVs but in a less expensive, smaller package.\n- It’s an adept daily-driver that’s also packed with the right amount of practicality and fun-to-drive.\n- It’s not always easy for a luxury brand to build an entry-level model that still feels true to that brand, but Mercedes has accomplished this here. \n\n## Total Rating: 4 stars\n\n---\n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\n\nThe base A220 starts at just under $34,000 for the front-wheel-drive model. Standard features on all models includes faux leather seats that are power-operated up front, 40/20/40 split folding rear seats, dual-zone climate control, app connectivity including remote start, panoramic roof, 17-inch alloy wheels, a start/stop system, LED headlamps and taillamps, backup camera, a seven-inch digital instrument panel plus a dashboard-mounted, seven-inch touchscreen for infotainment system that is controlled by touchpad, and Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. \n\n\n![F8A0765](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1Fgachr2Z4jUAjeC1OaETW/6b5d18f115f0247388788763576102e4/_F8A0765.jpg)\n\nFront-wheel-drive is standard on the A220, while Mercedes’ A220 4Matic all-wheel-drive system adds another $2,000. \n\nDespite this reasonable starting price, our tester clocked in at a cool $45,200. What happened? Options, lots of them. \n\nThe big ones were the $1,550 Premium Package (which added two huge 10.25-inch digital screens, one for the instrument panel and one for the dashboard; keyless entry and start, and power-folding side-view mirrors), and the $2,310 AMG line package (unique exterior body cladding and grille, and perforated disc brakes). There were others that should come standard on any luxury car -- entry-level or not -- like heated front seats or blind-spot assist.\n\n---\n \n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n \n ## Also consider\n This Mercedes A220 doesn’t have a deep bench of competitors against it. \n\nBMW is about to launch a new front-wheel-drive 2 Series four-door coupe that will likely be the A-Class’s biggest rivals. There’s also Audi’s A3 sedan and Acura’s ILX. \n\nWhile we haven’t yet driven the BMW, we would recommend that people interested in the A220 take a look at the A3 as well, though we’d probably choose the Mercedes if for no other reason than it’s much newer. The Acura can’t quite match this A220 in terms of panache but it’s also thousands of dollars less than the three German models listed here. ",

      "body": "Autolist rating: __3/5__\nBut would we buy it? __Yep!__\nPrice range: __$33,540 - $88,395__, including destination but before options\n\n## Key takeaways\n- The Grand Cherokee wraps Jeep capability with a quiet, luxurious SUV package.\n- A variety of powertrains are offered, from a V6 all the way up to a 707-horsepower supercharged V-8.\n- Jeep offers FCA’s Uconnect app to remotely start, lock/unlock, and locate a vehicle from a smartphone.\n- The Grand Cherokee can tow up to 7,200 pounds.\n\n\n![JP018 087GC43u06po3hmqnclclpd9fvoef5s](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/33M9kRXWBIC9kl2sYsCOsL/5dd1d95428988dd77d58f44f7f74bb27/JP018_087GC43u06po3hmqnclclpd9fvoef5s.jpg)\n\n---\n\n\n## What is it?\n\nThe Grand Cherokee is a five-passenger, midsize SUV that competes against a variety of premium and near-premium crossovers and SUVs, including the Ford Edge, Honda Passport, Toyota 4Runner and Highlander, Nissan Murano, and Chevy Blazer.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee sits atop Jeep’s lineup of crossovers and SUVs (though a new Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer are expected in the near future, which will top the Grand Cherokee in terms of size, price, and amenities). \n\nBelow the Grand Cherokee in Jeep’s lineup sit the Cherokee, the Compass, and the Renegade, plus the Wrangler and its Gladiator pickup version. \n\nThe Grand Cherokee is aimed at new car buyers that want the space and usability of a larger SUV but don’t need a third row. \n\nThis Jeephasn’t been thoroughly updated in quite a while, but the SUV is still relevant and competitive in its segment, thanks to seriously updated technologies and the latest in advanced safety equipment. Jeep has given the Grand Cherokee better engines as well, and the SUV has gone from a mostly off-road-focused vehicle to one that will scorch all four of its tires on the dragstrip or comfortably shuffle a family to the nearest strip mall, depending on the model.\n\n\n![JP020 053GCaqv5v3egng8s6lvcugbt5mv67m](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/h2iDdAVkKdQ3tRJMdeKWI/87b86a0849c9679652802b4e84ee2c3a/JP020_053GCaqv5v3egng8s6lvcugbt5mv67m.jpg)\n\n\n\nThe Grand Cherokee is offered in seven trims: the base Laredo trim, Limited, Trailhawk, Overland, Summit, SRT, and Trackhawk (seen above). Several special editions are available at any given time, which tend to combine popular elements from various trims into one package. Current special editions include the Upland, High Altitude, and Limited X.\n\n The Grand Cherokee’s standard powertrain includes a 3.6-liter V-6 engine that produces 295 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. \n\nThe Grand Cherokee SRT has a 6.4-liter V-8 that has 475 horsepower and 470 pound-feet of torque, and the Trackhawk model comes with a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 that produces 707 horsepower and 645 pound-feet of torque. \n\nA 5.7-liter V-8 is optional for certain trims and has 360 horsepower and 390 pound-feet of torque out of the box. That’s all in a package with excellent towing capacity and enough cargo space for the entire family to bring their gear. \n\nA diesel engine was offered in the Grand Cherokee earlier in this generation’s lifespan but has since been discontinued. \n\n\n---\n\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n\n## What’s good?\n\n*TLDR: The 2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a handsome, comfortable SUV with legitimate off-road ability.*\n\n__Styling:__ Jeep hasn’t given the Grand Cherokee a complete overhaul in many years, but it still looks contemporary, thanks to smooth lines and handsome sculpting. The tidy styling continues inside, where buttons and controls are neatly organized and placed well within reach of the driver.\n\n\n![JP018 095GCq6f7qfr0ktk8dapkbbum3uthha](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5LVO4NLtLdBEAoEvXjuCzw/75da31d5addc540f91d45a6dd2475009/JP018_095GCq6f7qfr0ktk8dapkbbum3uthha.jpg)\n\n\n __Comfortable:__ When sitting in the driver’s seat of a Grand Cherokee, it’s hard to believe that the SUV occupies the same brand’s lineup as vehicles like the Wrangler and the Gladiator. The Grand Cherokee’s interior is spacious, well-organized, and friendly for a wide variety of driver body shapes and sizes.\n\n__Capable:__ Yes, it has a towing rating of over 7,000 pounds, and yes, higher trim levels do come filled with soft leathers and tech. Even so, the Grand Cherokee is still a Jeep and can still hold its own when the pavement ends. Special off-road editions are offered, and there’s a Trailhawk trim with special tires and other rugged touches. Even lower trims with street tires have solid off-road capability.\n\n\n---\n\n## What’s bad?\n\n*TLDR: The Grand Cherokee gets pricey in higher trims, the platform is getting old, and several safety features are locked away in options packages.*\n\n__Expensive:__ Most of the “cool stuff” that can be had with the Grand Cherokee comes with a fairly significant price tag. Higher trims like the Summit model start at a higher price than some SUVs’ fully-loaded price tag, and it’s not hard to get a V6 model’s price tag past the $50,000 mark\n\n__Aging:__ It’s comfortable and still good looking, but there’s no denying that the Grand Cherokee is starting to show its age. Rough roads make themselves known with a bumpy ride and plenty of noise. The interior materials, design, and features are subpar when compared to more modern rivals.  It also makes a lot of noise under full throttle without doing much actual acceleration. \n\n\n![JP018 109GCqvcpb5e90ah4pu1ganj8vbh8op](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3i9drwlz0PWpu9A5eJ1awF/77b3550bb444e6c16c7544a7734dfa2a/JP018_109GCqvcpb5e90ah4pu1ganj8vbh8op.jpg)\n\n\n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n## 5 stars of execution\nSafety Features? __YES__\n\n- Jeep includes several advanced safety features as standard equipment, including pre-collision emergency braking, rear cross-traffic alerts, blind-spot monitoring, rear parking sensors, and more. \n\n- Other features like forward-collision warnings and adaptive cruise control are included in an optional Jeep Active Safety Group. The Grand Cherokee scored a “Marginal” rating for driver-side front crashworthiness, a “Poor” rating for passenger-side, and “Good” in other crashworthiness areas by the IIHS. The Jeep’s headlights were given “Acceptable” or “Poor” ratings, depending on the model and configuration. \n\n- In spite of those ratings from the IIHS, the Grand Cherokee still scored five stars in NHTSA crash tests.\n\n\nValue? __NO__\n\n- There’s really no sweet spot for Grand Cherokee prices, as many of the features that make it worth buying are only available in higher trims, which cost quite a bit more than the Laredo model’s starting price. \n\n- The Grand Cherokee has a tough time matching the value and modernity of most of its rivals. \n![JP020 071GCnv25n16gd991kehsalmnov1ieg](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/XYELXabzjdRU5lEn282Cl/790159089dc414c8b8a9ad050466f14d/JP020_071GCnv25n16gd991kehsalmnov1ieg.jpg)\n\nEfficiency? __NO__\n\n- With two-wheel drive and the V-6 engine on board, the Grand Cherokee lands at 19/26/21 mpg city/highway/combined. Four-wheel drive cuts fuel economy slightly to 18/25/21 mpg.\n\n- Those numbers are competitive, but rivals like the Ford Explorer are able to do better. Grand Cherokee models equipped with a V-8 engine are downright thirsty, scoring 15 mpg combined for the SRT trim and 13 mpg combined for the Trackhawk.\n\n- We miss the diesel option, which offered significantly better gas mileage and plenty of torque for towing.\n\n\nDriving experience? __YES__ \n\n- The Grand Cherokee does well at most things, and while it’s not particularly nimble, it feels cohesive and planted over most road surfaces. This is one area where the model has really aged well. \n\n- The Trackhawk model we tested is a fire-breathing dragon of an SUV and can sprint from 0-60 mph faster than many supercars.\n\nExecution? __YES__\n\n- Jeep struck a high note with the Grand Cherokee when the current generation rolled out years ago, and the brand has only improved on the formula since then. \n\n- The newest Grand Cherokee is luxurious, extremely capable, and great looking. Higher trims with the larger touchscreen and Uconnect can run Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which adds several entertainment and app functions.\n\n\n##  Total Rating:  3 stars\n\n\n![JP018 062GCurf75cejvuftutq13nbrs97j4c](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4MysxU8LswQcR1S6HAt0eb/a6477db288cdaa1007460123a274ad03/JP018_062GCurf75cejvuftutq13nbrs97j4c.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n--- \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\n\nThe base Jeep Grand Cherokee __Laredo__ has a starting MSRP of $33,540 including a $1,495 destination charge, and comes standard with a V-6 engine, an eight-speed automatic gearbox, automatic headlights, daytime running lights, fog lights, heated mirrors, 17-inch wheels, dual-zone climate controls, a folding rear seat, cloth upholstery, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, two USB ports, two 12-volt power outlets, Bluetooth, a six-speaker sound system, a seven-inch touchscreen infotainment unit, blind-spot monitors, electronic stability control, hill-start assist, rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, rain braking support, automatic emergency braking, rear cross-traffic alerts, and trailer sway control.\n\nFour-wheel drive is a $2,300 option.\n\nThe Jeep Grand Cherokee __Limited__ starts at $41,350 after destination and comes with a power liftgate, power-folding mirrors, a remote start system, a power sunroof, 18-inch wheels, a memory driver’s seat, memory radio stations and presets, leather upholstery, power front seats, a heated steering wheel, an 8.4-inch touchscreen infotainment system, navigation, and SiriusXM satellite radio.\n\n\n\n![JP020 028GCgtcg5iek2rlgss9noqjs9q8g1m](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6inLHbN2H7wEraPb5OykEu/29d0a30e12094e4343cd597882f2c048/JP020_028GCgtcg5iek2rlgss9noqjs9q8g1m.jpg)\n\nThe Grand Cherokee __Trailhawk__ has a starting price of $46,450 after destination and comes with a dual exhaust system, increased-travel suspension, a rear load-leveling package, 18-inch wheels with all-terrain tires, leather/suede upholstery, and heated second-row seats.

The Explorer ST is edging on performance SUV territory, but prices climb quickly. Despite being all-new, the Explorer trails some of its rivals in terms of interior refinement and materials. \n\nThe Toyota 4Runner is aging, just like the Grand Cherokee, but it’s also doing so gracefully. The Toyota lags slightly in tech and comfort features, but the 4Runner is every bit as legendary as the Grand Cherokee, both on and off-road. \n\nThe Honda Passport was new for 2019 and uses electronic gadgetry to increase its off-road credibility. It won’t do heavy-duty off-roading, but to be fair, the Grand Cherokee doesn’t either. The Honda is capable enough to earn its place in the midsize SUV segment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "__Highlights:__\n\n- Word-of-mouth from friends, family, and coworkers has the biggest impact on what vehicle people buy, with 52 percent of respondents saying it had influenced their decision. \n\n- Data-backed organizations like Consumer Reports and J.D. Power ranked second on the list of influences for car shopping, with 33 percent of respondents saying this had influenced them.\n\n- Media awards like the North American Car/Truck/Utility of the Year, and those handed out by outlets like Motor Trend, Car & Driver, KBB.com, and Edmunds.com ranked third, with 26 percent of shoppers citing their influence. \n\n- Social media influencers ranked low, with just 11 percent of respondents across all age groups citing them as influential.\n\n- Younger shoppers (18-23 years old) had different influences than all other age groups; this cohort relied more on social media influencers and YouTube than any of the other age groups, and less on data-backed organizations. \n\n---\n\n__Full story:__\n\nWhen it comes to influencing a car shopper’s decision on what to buy, nothing has the power of old fashioned word-of-mouth, according to the latest survey by Autolist.com.\n\nThe poll found that personal recommendations -- from friends, family, and coworkers -- ranked as having the biggest influence on a car-buying decision, with 52 percent of respondents saying it had influenced their purchase in the past. \n\nThat majority was well ahead of the other influences respondents could choose from, which included recommendations by data-backed organizations (*Consumer Reports* and *J.D. Power*), media awards (North American vehicle of the year, *Motor Trend* Vehicle of the Year, etc.), YouTube reviews, community recommendations (Reddit, Facebook groups, online forums), and social media influencers on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook. \n\n“When someone in your immediate circle has a good or bad experience with anything, it makes you feel better about making the same decision,” said Chase Disher, analyst at Autolist. “Because cars are such a huge purchase in our lives, word-of-mouth means that much more here.”\n\nTesla and its all-electric lineup of cars and crossovers is perhaps the most obvious example of what strong word-of-mouth can do for an automaker’s success. The brand is famously averse to marketing and advertising and yet it easily outsells its more entrenched EV rivals by a wide margin. \n\nAutolist surveyed more than 1,100 current car shoppers in late January and early February to conduct the survey. Respondents were given a list of influences on their car buying in the past and asked to pick up to three that affected them. \n\n__Trusting data__\n\nWhile the ‘Personal Recommendations’ category was the top pick, ‘Data-backed media recommendations' from *Consumer Reports* and *J.D. Power* ranked second, with 33 percent of shoppers surveyed saying they had influenced their purchase in the past. \n\nBoth of these organizations have long provided objective and quantitative rankings, paired with recommendations of brands and specific models. This has earned them a high degree of trust among consumers; that they also review products beyond cars means their reach and name recognition are extensive. \n\n“Clearly there’s a lot of goodwill and respect for the Consumer Reports and J.D. Power brands that extends outside of the car-shopping experience,” Disher said. “That serves them well when people do enter the car-buying funnel.\" \n\nThus, automakers themselves have come to covet a high ranking from either of the two entities. \n\n![Chevrolet JD Power](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7qpPnTKRbU8LeBg8uBzuHt/b74e512296721d86d58a32f290f805ff/Chevy_JD_Power.jpg)\n\nJ.D. Power awards are regularly touted by automakers in their advertising (a privilage for which automakers like Chevrolet, seen above, must pay J.D. Power).\n\nConsumer Reports doesn't allow its name or awards to be used in advertising, but automakers still take their impressions seriously. Honda famously revamped the 2013 Civic after the 2012 model was so poorly received by Consumer Reports that the outlet dropped it from its 'Recommended' list for the first time in 20 years. \n\n__Media Awards__\n\nThe third most-influential platform for car shoppers in Autolist’s survey were ‘Media Awards,’ handed out by the likes of *Car & Driver*, *Motor Trend*, the North American Car, Truck, and Utility of the Year, Kelley Blue Book (KBB.com), Edmunds.com, Autotrader.com, and Cars.com. \n\nJust over a quarter of respondents (26 percent) said awards from outlets like these had influenced their purchase consideration. \n\nWhen respondents were asked which of these outlets they trusted the most (they could pick up to three), the top three choices were KBB, Autotrader, and Edmunds.\n\n__Other influences__\n\nYouTube reviews were a close fourth in the ranked list of car-buying influences in Autolist’s survey. Across all age groups, 22 percent of shoppers said YouTube reviews played a role in their purchase consideration. \n\n“Other” ranked fifth in Autolist’s ranking of influences, with 17.43 percent of shoppers choosing this option. \n\nJust under 17 percent of respondents (16.51) said they had been influenced by so-called ‘Community Recommendations’ -- input from various message boards like Reddit, Facebook Groups, or other online forums. \n\nSocial media influencers on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok was seventh on Autolist’s rankings, chosen by 11 percent of respondents. \n\nFinally, nine percent of those polled chose “None of the above.”\n\n__Youthful outliers__\n\nInterestingly, younger shoppers in Autolist’s survey (those 18 to 23 years old) cited notably different influences in their purchase considerations than their fellow respondents. \n\nThis age group cited YouTube as the second-most influential source (behind friends/family/coworkers), with 36 percent of respondents choosing it. That compares with the aforementioned 22 percent of respondents of all ages citing YouTube as influential.\n\nThis younger age group also placed the least importance on the grouping of data-backed organizations; just 15 percent of people 18 to 23 years old said these were influential, compared to the survey average of 33 percent across all age groups. \n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, this age cohort also relied more on social media influencers than any of their older peers. Seventeen percent of people 18 to 23 years old said their car-buying decision was impacted by social media posts, far higher than any other age group. That compares to just 11 percent of respondents across all age groups saying social media affected their decision. ",

Toyota has maintained the 4Runner’s off-road focus while adding new tech and comfort features that help bring the old-school SUV gracefully into 2020.\n\nThe 4Runner is aimed at buyers that are looking for a rugged SUV with plenty of creature comforts and room for the family. There are six trim levels available for the 2020 model year: SR5, SR5 Premium, TRD Off-Road, TRD Off-Road Premium, TRD Pro, and Limited. Two special editions are also available: Nightshade and Venture. \n\nAll models come standard with a 4.0-liter V6 that makes 270 horsepower and 278 pound-feet of torque. This engine is paired with a five-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel-drive. Two types of four-wheel-drive are offered, depending on the trim level.\n\n\n\n\n![2014 Toyota 4Runner Limited 010 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1fwV6wWzrIp5fIbAQdek4q/76cb8711ad9d5fd57cdd74540d157c0e/2014_Toyota_4Runner_Limited_010__1_.jpg)\n\nToyota has updated the 4Runner for 2020 with an advanced driver assistance package called Toyota Safety Sense P, which has features like a pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warnings, and automatic high beam headlights. \n\nThe upgraded infotainment now offers Apple CarPlay for the first time, and the instrument cluster has a 4.2-inch display for trip info and fuel economy figures. \n\nThis Toyota doesn’t have much in the way of direct competition, but people shopping for the 4Runner may also look at the Chevrolet Tahoe, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Wrangler, Ford Escape, or even the Honda Passport. The upcoming Ford Bronco and Land Rover Defender will both eventually creep in on the 4Runner’s territory.\n\n---\n\n## What’s good?\n*TLDR: Capable off-road, plus reliable and comfy.*\n\n__Reliability:__ Toyota has historically landed at or near the top of reliability ratings lists, and the 4Runner is no exception. The 2019 version has an above-average rating, and we routinely see older models run well past the upper limits of what other vehicles are able to achieve. This will also help keep the 4Runner’s resale value high. \n\n __Rugged:__ It’s probably true that many 4Runner owners will almost never take their SUV off-road, but it’s also true that this Toyota is an incredibly capable vehicle if and when they do. Even the cushy Limited model has the ability to tackle nearly any terrain or weather conditions, and the more off-road-focused TRD models are downright beasts when the pavement ends.\n\n![2018 Toyota 4Runner Limited 012 3844E9A9161C8727F63FB4FC04CF04F074C50DFB (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/U4utI0TIEOeUc8QzusXl9/088ef908b9028efa618bee4adc2a5201/2018_Toyota_4Runner_Limited_012_3844E9A9161C8727F63FB4FC04CF04F074C50DFB__1_.jpg)\n\n\n__Comfortable:__ Despite its body-on-frame construction, generous ground clearance, and off-road abilities, the 4Runner drives and behaves mostly like a docile family cruiser on the road. The ride is more than decent, and interior finishes are warm and inviting. The seats are wide, supportive, and work well for longer drives. Second-row passengers are treated to a spacious seat with plenty of padding to keep things comfortable on long drives.\n\n---\n\n## What’s bad?\n\n*TLDR: Poor fuel economy, acceleration is sluggish, and the price tag will put off some buyers.*\n\n__Fuel Economy:__ The 4Runner achieves 16/19/17 mpg city/highway/combined, which puts it down near the numbers that full-size pickup trucks get. The thirsty nature of the Toyota may be outweighed by its off-road prowess for some people, but for everyday commuters, the frequent visits to the pump may get tiresome.\n\n__Sluggish Acceleration:__ The 4Runner’s 4.0-liter V-6 makes a rowdy noise but doesn’t do much to push the SUV down the road with any particular urgency. Accelerating to highway speeds is an exercise in patience, and hill climbs take multiple downshifts before becoming tolerable. Even worse, it’s paired with an outdated five-speed automatic transmission, in an era when many SUVs have eight- and nine-speed gearboxes. \n\n![2019 4Runner TRD Off Road 08 8B6486DD31B6FE393277C62942EA79E294751BFF (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2GjAks1ttxR5XmwofDhCKJ/85f6ca2103d54959ec680e56980d64a6/2019_4Runner_TRD_Off_Road_08_8B6486DD31B6FE393277C62942EA79E294751BFF__1_.jpg)\n\n__Pricing:__ Choosing anything other than one of the SR5 trims will drive the 4Runner’s price up quickly. It’s easy to spend over $50,000, especially for a TRD model. That’s not completely out of line with other tough SUVs, but for many buyers, there are better choices with more features for the price.\n\n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n## 5 stars of execution\n\nSafety Features? __YES__\n\n- Toyota’s addition of its Safety Sense equipment package to the 4Runner is a welcome update that brings features like automatic emergency braking, lane departure alerts, and adaptive cruise control. \n\n- Despite that, the 4Runner received mixed marks in IIHS safety testing. The Toyota’s front driver-side crashworthiness was rated “Marginal”, its headlights received a “Poor” score, and the LATCH system ease of use was rated “Marginal”. \n\n- The SUV also lacks blind-spot monitors, which are not included in Safety Sense P. None of those things mean that the 4Runner is an unsafe vehicle, but do speak to the platform’s overall age and sophistication.\n\nValue? __NO__\n\n- Buyers seeking a stripped-down off-roader will be irked by the 4Runner’s starting price of well over $30,000, and others that want a luxury SUV will be better served with a wide variety of premium crossovers and SUVs for the same price as the top-end 4Runner. \n\n- Though it’s got very strong reliability ratings and is more than tolerable as a daily driver, the Toyota doesn’t have enough clever features to stand up against the competition from a value standpoint.\n\nEfficiency? __NO__\n\n- The 4Runner’s 16/19/17 mpg city/highway/combined is nearing the numbers that full-size pickup trucks achieve. \n\n- The old-school V-6 engine and downright antiquated five-speed transmission combine with a heavy, body-on-frame SUV to make a relatively fuel-thirsty package.\n\n![2018 Toyota 4Runner Trail 020 437D1796BDE5A68C84CE9C59B716DBE7FAC55D84 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5AmUjrzvsOvRHjASqUq9tO/f6e35afb1efb50c34e9f7fcfcb25779a/2018_Toyota_4Runner_Trail_020_437D1796BDE5A68C84CE9C59B716DBE7FAC55D84__1_.jpg)\n\nDriving experience? __YES__ \n\n- As a commuter, the 4Runner is quiet and surprisingly refined. As an off-road companion, it will take you as far as you care to go. \n\n- Even with its tall ride height, off-road-tuned suspension, and truck-like underpinnings, the Toyota is comfortable and controlled in most driving situations. \n\nExecution? __YES__\n\n- To stay relevant for over a decade with the same basic formula, the 4Runner had to be good from the get-go, which it absolutely is. \n\n- Toyota’s subtle updates over the years, combined with the fact that the 4Runner is built like a tank, means that a lack of major updates hasn’t been the lethal blow to the SUV like it would for lesser vehicles.\n\n## Total Rating: 3 stars\n\n--- \n\n![2018 Toyota 4Runner Trail 014 F37BF000900401406038037D847A45D669C47F8A (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6jfS7op6I6dVHDfOG5a67t/7578f7b483dcbdd27ca8fc251eb5688a/2018_Toyota_4Runner_Trail_014_F37BF000900401406038037D847A45D669C47F8A__1_.jpg)\n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\n\nThe base 4Runner __SR5__ has a starting MSRP of $37,240 including a $1,120 destination charge, and comes with projector headlights, 17-inch wheels, front and rear mudguards, fog lights, Amazon Alexa capability, LED taillights, air conditioning, cruise control, folding rear seats, three USB ports, a 12-volt power outlet in the cargo area, power windows and door locks, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, ten cup holders, and front skid plates.\n\nFour-wheel drive is a $1,875 option.\n\nThe 4Runner __SR5 Premium__ has a starting price of $40,435 after destination, and comes with Softex faux-leather upholstery, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, color-matched bumpers, door handles, and mirrors, and has a smart key system with push-button start.\n\nFour-wheel drive is a $1,875 option.\n\nThe Toyota __4Runner TRD Off-Road__ has a starting price of $40,960 after destination and comes with four-wheel drive, 17-inch seven-spoke wheels, black exterior trim, special all-weather floor mats, and TRD badges.\n\nA __TRD Premium__ model is available that comes with Softex upholstery and red TRD logos.\n\nThe Toyota __4Runner TRD Pro__ has a starting price of $51,016 after destination and comes standard with 2.5-inch Fox shocks front and rear, TRD-tuned front springs, a TRD exhaust, TRD roof rack, LED fog lights, a TRD skid plate, matte-black 17-inch wheels, a special “TOYOTA” grille, a JBL sound system, power moonroof, and TRD badges.\n\nThe __4Runner Limited__ trim has a starting price of $46,105 and comes standard with dual-zone climate controls, perforated leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, power seats, 20-inch wheels, silver exterior trim, and a power moonroof with sunshade.\n\n![2018 Toyota 4Runner Trail 019 5D43431EC3347EF173C5D64DBD86207EBCE880A0 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4LrQ83DlJRLDbIB7eAzE4E/e1f6b2ea6f383c24063b24e6fea7f2a1/2018_Toyota_4Runner_Trail_019_5D43431EC3347EF173C5D64DBD86207EBCE880A0__1_.jpg)\n\nFour-wheel drive is a $2,035 option for Limited models.\n\nIf it were our money, __we’d buy the Toyota 4Runner Limited__. It sidesteps the top-end price that the TRD Pro model commands while bringing more creature comforts for the daily commute.\n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n## Also consider:\n\nThe 4Runner competes in a growing two-row SUV segment. Rivals like the Passport and Edge have fresher styling and better results in crash tests, but not many can match the Toyota’s off-road capability. \n\nBuyers may also shop the Toyota Tacoma, which has some similar features in a pickup truck shape. Shoppers needing a third row and a more car-like experience would be better served looking at the Toyota Highlander.\n\nThe Honda Passport was introduced in 2019, and it has a compelling mix of capability and usability. It’s not a hardcore off-roader, but Honda used enough electronic trickery to give the Passport a surprising level of traction and function when the going gets tough.\n\nThe Jeep Grand Cherokee, like the 4Runner, is extremely capable off-road and comfortable on the pavement. The Jeep has a much nicer interior, more advanced tech, and cushier seats, but it too approaches pricing levels that rival many luxury brands. More hardcore off-road enthusiasts would be better served with a Jeep Wrangler, which actually has a similar mix of off-road heritage and capabilities plus on-road refinement and practicality.\n\nThis year the 4Runner will see two new competitors arise from the ashes. Ford is bringing back the Bronco as an off-road-oriented SUV, and Land Rover will relaunch the Defender nameplate on a rugged two-door and four-door SUVs. Both will likely strike at the heart of the lifestyle SUV segment that the 4Runner and Wrangler currently dominate. \n\n![2019 4Runner TRD Off Road 07 61F00D5C255369ACDC59AEADFBB2E42E4381BAC7 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3SBTHJiabhfgARkuKyq06n/219b09d6c24afd1080beb52bae87b2c6/2019_4Runner_TRD_Off_Road_07_61F00D5C255369ACDC59AEADFBB2E42E4381BAC7__1_.jpg)\n\n",

      "body": "Maybe, you're thinking about buying a car to replace the one you have or need a second car for the family. Of course, new cars are expensive and depreciate almost as soon as you drive them off the lot. This makes it a good idea to buy a used car with low mileage and only a couple of years old. Surely, you've heard of manufacturer CPO cars, but you wonder if independent dealerships can sell them too. Here are some things you need to know. \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### What Is a Manufacturer CPO Car?\n\nA manufacturers COP is a certified previously owned car, and the manufacturer, such as Honda, Toyota, Ford and others, certified that the car is in good condition. Most of these cars are low mileage and less than five to seven years old. Many dealerships also provide a CarFax report on CPO cars. Each manufacturer has its own guidelines as to age and mileage, so it's a good idea to look over the manufacturer's program before buying a CPO vehicle. \n\nThe manufacturers check specific mechanical systems and ensure the car is in great condition before offering it up as a manufacturer CPO. For the most part, the certifications are done at the dealership for that manufacturer. For example, you can't a Mazda CPO car at a Honda dealership. After checking specific mechanics in the car, the manufacturer dealership may make small repairs as part of the certification program. Most manufacturer dealerships pay a fee for the used cars that become part of the CPO program.  The goal is to give a buyer — you — peace of mind that you're getting a quality used car that doesn't breakdown as soon as you drive it off the lot. There are other benefits as well. \n\nThese cars come with a CPO warranty against problems and repairs needed by the vehicle within a certain timeframe and a specific allotment of miles. If the car still has an original manufacturer warranty covering it, both warranties tend to run concurrently. Once again, these programs vary by manufacturer so it's beneficial to check with the dealership before buying. \n\nThe manufacturer CPO vehicle may include other benefits beyond the warranty. This might include roadside assistance or a free loaner vehicle if the car needs repairs. Others might offer upgrades, such as free satellite radio. \n\nWhen you need work done on your manufacturer CPO vehicle, you can have it done at any of the manufacturer's dealerships. For example, if you bought a Honda CPO car in Atlanta and then moved to Oklahoma City, you could take the car to a Honda dealership in Oklahoma City for repairs. \n\n### Independent Dealership\n\nSo, no, an independent dealer can't sell you a manufacturer CPO car. However, there is one exception. If a car had a CPO warranty that hasn't expired yet, it would go with the car. For instance, Alan bought a CPO Honda Accord, kept for three months and then traded it in for the Porsche of his dreams at an independent dealership. You go to the same independent dealership and buy that CPO Honda Accord. You get any remaining benefits of the CPO warranty. \n\nSome independent dealerships can sell you an additional warranty on their used cars. The benefits and costs of these policies vary greatly. It's beneficial to do your research and know exactly what you're getting in an extended warranty before you purchase it. When you purchase a used car from an independent dealership, you want to ask what if any inspections and testing they've done on the vehicle. \n\n### Extended Warranty\n\nA used car doesn't have to be a CPO to have an extended warranty or breakdown insurance. Many independent dealerships can sell you an extended warranty on a used car. However, these aren't coming from the factory or manufacturer but from a third party company who sells the policy and who coordinates any needed repairs. You will have to pay for an extended warranty from an independent dealership, whereas the CPO vehicle has the cost of the warranty already built into the final price. \n\nExtended warranties offer a variety of choices for coverage and cost. If you're buying a used car and an extended warranty, you might want to do your research. Before buying the car and warranty, go online and look for reviews of the extended warranty company. If you find many pleased customers and only one or two angry clients, it might be a case of sour grapes. Carefully read over the extended warranty to learn the details of covered repairs and ones that aren't covered. There are some aftermarket warranties out there that are as good as the CPO warranties if you take your time and do your research. There are also other options for buying a good certified used car. \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Certified Rental Cars\n\nYou might not think of a rental car as a possible used car but rental car agencies often sell their used cars to the public. Many of these cars are only a few years old but may have high mileage. Many car rental programs run their own certification program for selling their used cars to the public. \n\nAs an example, it's believed that Hertz, a popular car rental company, uses Pep Boys to do a certification and complete any repairs needed before offering the car to the public. Hertz's certification warranty is 12 months or 12,000 miles, whichever comes first. Of course, if the car's factory warranty is still good, then this warranty runs at the same time, but most repairs are done by the manufacturer.\n\nIn addition to the warranty, Hertz offers other incentives to buy one of their used cars. They offer towing, car rentals and roadside assistance so your used car is covered no matter where you roam. Many of the large car rental agencies have similar programs to certify their used cars. It's beneficial to do a little research and ask lots of questions before buying one of these certified used cars.\n\nWhen it comes to used cars, you want to buy one that you can rely on. A manufacturer CPO car can provide some peace of mind and a warranty against future needed repairs. However, while independent dealerships can't sell you a manufacturer CPO vehicle, they can offer similar warranties. Car rental agencies work hard to ensure their used cars are safe and reliable at the time of the purchase",

It will compete with other modestly priced, smaller electric vehicles such as the Chevrolet Bolt, Hyundai Ioniq Electric, Kia Niro EV, Nissan Leaf, Volkswagen e-Golf – and to some extent, the Tesla Model 3.\n\nThe Mini Electric sits between the Mini Cooper Hardtop and the Mini Cooper S Hardtop, which are the smallest vehicles in the British brand’s current range. These two-door hatchbacks are some of the smallest cars on the road in the U.S., which has historically made them popular in urban settings – as well as among those who like their throwback styling and cool design cues. \n\nTo that end, though, the Cooper SE receives relatively few changes to the Hardtop models, introduced in their current form in 2013 and lightly updated in 2019. The exterior has some modifications to the bumper and a largely filled-in grille, with yellow accents throughout, and a redesigned underside to improve aerodynamics. The profile, however, remains the same. Aside from some SE-specific wheel designs, most passersby will quickly recognize it as a Mini.\n\nAll EV models get a 32.6 kWh battery pack and an electric motor that produces the equivalent of 184 horsepower with a single-speed “transmission.”\n\nThere are three trims on the Cooper SE: Signature, Signature Plus and Iconic.\n\nRange is estimated by Mini to be about 110 miles on a single charge, in optimal conditions; the EPA rating hasn’t been released yet. \n\n---\n\n## What’s good?\n*TLDR: Cute, bubbly… cheap?*\n\n__Modern icon:__ It’s a classic look, and modifying the Mini to fit an electric drive system hasn’t altered its appearance much. Subtle yellow accents let people know you’re in the electric model, but the overall shape is retained.\n\n![GS MINI Cooper SE 012020 00296 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3VcEY3lrcsERbDsGkug2YM/e5b81f808261c2d615370f019d8cc373/GS_MINI_Cooper_SE_012020_00296__1_.jpg)\n\n__Smile-inducing driving experience:__ Minis are also known to be fun to drive, and the added weight of a battery pack hasn’t dulled the Cooper SE. It feels livelier than its 0-60 mph time of 6.9 seconds suggests, and its handling is especially perky around town.\n\n__Relatively affordable EV:__ The roughly $30,000 starting price before tax incentives make the Cooper SE one of the least expensive ways to get a new electric car. That’s even more impressive considering the standard features include items such as dual-zone climate control, alloy wheels and navigation.\n\n---\n\n## What’s bad?\n*TLDR: Small and quirky, and don’t stray too far from a plug.*\n\n__Think small:__ It’s still a small car, and while the addition of a battery hasn’t impacted the space for passengers and cargo, this is more of a two-seat vehicle with two occasional seats. The two-door hatchback configuration will also make it tough to get people in the back, as well as fit car seats.\n\n__Quirky controls:__ Those unfamiliar with recent Mini models may have a learning curve to endure with the interior controls. The infotainment system is controlled by both touchscreen and a rotary knob on the narrow space between the front seats, while the seat controls are unusually arranged.\n\n![RN MINI Cooper SE 012020 00122 01](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5aNhvHyOIB49zA1YsVYaR9/1d31827ff140ea9fad06e883353d2735/RN_MINI_Cooper_SE_012020_00122_01.jpg)\n\n__A range of issue:__ Then, there’s the battery range. The EPA hasn’t confirmed ratings for the Cooper SE yet, but even Mini estimates it at 110 miles on a full charge – and in optimal weather and driving conditions. Keeping the air conditioning on full blast or engaging the fun Sport mode will decrease that considerably. Consider that when buying.\n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n## 5 stars of execution\n\nSafety Features? __SOME__\n\n- While the IIHS and NHTSA haven’t tested the electric version yet, the Mini Hardtop models earned top marks from the Institute and four stars out of five overall from the government agency.\n- Forward collision warning is standard, driver assistance technologies such as lane departure warning or full-speed automatic braking are unavailable. Models like Nissan Leaf make those features available around this price point.\n\nValue? __YES__\n\n- The Cooper SE is about $2,000 more than a Cooper S but hardly deprived of standard equipment. Loaded with options, and it approaches $40,000, but remember, that’s before a $7,500 federal tax credit and any other local or utility credits available in your area. That means a base model may pencil out better than a base Cooper Hardtop.\n- For electric vehicles with a similar range, the Cooper SE is competitively priced. \n\n![RN MINI Cooper SE 012020 00072 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1jtcscQqRIP0fvHUCtwsVC/867724b55794e11a7333f53b896fba7d/RN_MINI_Cooper_SE_012020_00072__1_.jpg)\n\n\nEfficiency? __YES__\n\n- The EPA hasn’t formalized testing of the Cooper SE, but BMW pegs range at 110 miles on a full charge, putting it near the bottom for EVs of its size and price. \n- Still, its 32.6 kWh battery is smaller than that of most modern EVs and enables for faster charging.\n\nDriving experience? __YES__\n\n- The most impressive part of the Cooper SE is its lively nature and how much it feels like the conventional models.\n- The ride is arguably softer than that on a comparable gas Hardtop, but the Cooper SE is still a bit bouncy over bumps. Refined, but only for a very small car.\n\nExecution? __YES__\n\n- This electric Mini is remarkable for being so similar to the gas models, hardly touching the looks or the zingy driving experience, let alone space inside.  \n- As electric cars go, it’s remarkably fun in both city and highway driving, even if it’s best-suited to urban areas.\n- Those looking for it to be their only vehicle for freeway driving might look elsewhere, but it’s worth seeing if the Mini Cooper SE fits in your life.\n\n\n![RN MINI Cooper SE 012020 00080 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4C2SAGT8DFs314ic0Thne3/959da8c21f684d5b47bcdd43b42ee034/RN_MINI_Cooper_SE_012020_00080__1_.jpg)\n\n\n## Total Rating: 4 stars\n\n---\n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\nThe Mini Cooper __SE__ starts from $30,750, including an $850 destination charge, but before applicable tax incentives. It comes in three trim levels.\n\nThe base __Signature edition__ includes basics such as 16-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights and taillights and fog lights, forward collision warning, power windows, keyless entry with push-button start, heated front seats, a 6.5-inch infotainment system with a navigation system and Apple CarPlay, a backup camera and a system to find charging stations. It also features leatherette upholstery, a digital instrument cluster and dual-zone automatic climate control.\n\n![GS MINI Cooper SE 012020 00312 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3UdTWwSz1H1w3aHQnV38m8/65680910738e0b54e1ab7ed01f90adf0/GS_MINI_Cooper_SE_012020_00312__1_.jpg)\n\nThe $34,750 __Signature Plus__ model adds items like 17-inch wheels, rear parking sensors, auto-dimming and power-folding exterior mirrors, moonroof, upgraded sound system and a garage door opener.\n\nThe top-spec $37,750 __Iconic__ model adds front parking sensors with an automated parking assistant system, a head-up display, a larger 8.8-inch infotainment screen with navigation and wireless phone charging.\n\nUnless you really need the moonroof, the base __Signature__ model is the best buy and reinforces the value proposition of the Cooper SE.\n\n![GS MINI Cooper SE 012020 00066 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1beof0Sd7ERkDocgH5h25i/cda929cf38265c3aebdabd339140d3e0/GS_MINI_Cooper_SE_012020_00066__1_.jpg)\n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n## Also consider:\nEVs with lots of range tend to be significantly more expensive than the Mini Electric, although you also pay a bit more for a less mainstream brand.

It’s a practical, five-door hatchback that’s still reasonably small on the outside, but the styling and interior quality don’t hold a candle to the Mini.\n\nThe __Hyundai Ioniq Electric__ also just received a range boost for 2020 to closer to 200 miles, is priced like a mid-level Mini, and is more practical, but lacks driver appeal.\n\nKia's __Niro EV__ is far more practical than the Mini, with an SUV-like shape and range well over 200 miles. It costs more, however, and isn’t known for a particularly rewarding driving experience.\n\n__Nissan's Leaf__ is compact and offers two versions with different ranges. The base model with 151 miles of range is well-priced and practical for up to five passengers. But the interior quality is lackluster.\n\n__Tesla's Model 3__ is a formidable rival with a range over 230 miles (and over 300 in some cases) that has a premium feel like the Mini. But it’s priced more like a BMW model.\n\nThe __Volkswagen e-Golf__ is about to be discontinued, and incentives on it aren’t as generous as they once were. But its range is similar to the Mini’s, with ample passenger space for four and hatchback versatility. \n\n__BMW's i3__ shares some of the drivetrain as the Mini Cooper SE and has also been around for longer. It has two small rear doors to assist access and has a more upscale interior that feels roomier. But it’s significantly more expensive, and the interior technology is also showing its age.\n",

This third-generation Cayenne was redesigned from the ground up for the 2019 model year, and it shares a platform with a variety of VW Group vehicles, including the Bentley Bentayga, Lamborghini Urus, and Audi Q7. \n \nThe Cayenne is available with a wide range of powertrains, hence the wide range in price. We tested the base Cayenne model, on top of which there are the E-Hybrid, S, Turbo, and Turbo S E-Hybrid variants. \n\n![S17 1281 fine (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3V6yejKDymPyt7r0K3Xpk/af2965c1d9361e637b09e9539e3026d2/S17_1281_fine__1_.jpg)\n \nThe base Cayenne is powered by a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 that makes 335 horsepower and 332 pound-feet of torque. It comes standard with all-wheel-drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission. Additional models come with this engine plus an electric motor, a twin-turbo V6, a twin-turbo V8, and a twin-turbo V8 plus electric motor. \n \nPorsche also makes the Cayenne Coupe, a four-door model with a fastback silhouette and less cargo space, for buyers who prioritize looks and performance over functional space. \n\n\n \nThe Cayenne is larger than Porsche’s compact Macan crossover. \n \n---\n \n## What’s good?\n*TLDR: Handles like you want it to, perfect size, impeccable interior.*\n\n__Porsche-worthy handling__ Porsche’s engineers did the brand a solid when tuning this Cayenne’s handling and road manners. Despite being an SUV, this is a surprisingly eager and responsive vehicle, one that can out-handle many lower sport sedans with similar power. The best part? This engagement doesn’t come at the expense of everyday comfort and drivability. This Cayenne packs plenty of that too.\n\n__Slick interior:__ Porsche is currently on top of its game when it comes to interiors, particularly the center console, instrument panel, and dashboard layout, materials, and execution. This Cayenne’s interior is no exception. It’s a future-looking, luxurious, and tightly bolted together.\n\n![P17 0775 a5 rgb (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/0NBoPIU4xi7d6f50JTr3r/b79341a7dd73e0d158bb0463057c65b8/P17_0775_a5_rgb__1_.jpg)\n\n\n__Smart size:__ Big enough to haul the family and their stuff, small enough to handle well (see above), and fit into tight parking spaces. In an era when SUVs are increasingly growing almost too big, this one is the perfect Goldilocks zone for size.\n \n---\n\n## What’s bad?\n*TLDR: Pricey with any options, base model looks like it.*\n \n__Gets expensive quickly:__ Our tester started at a cool $65,000, which is a little closer to the higher end of prices for this segment. And then the options started, many of which felt like they should be standard. Things like $3,750 for a full leather interior, $6610 for a premium package that added stuff like a Bose sound system, 14-way power seats, a panoramic roof, LED dynamic headlights, heated front seats, and lane-change assist. Out the door, our tester stickered for about $81,000. That’s a lot.\n \n![PCNA18 1837 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3P0U1c7rYnh8pIhYXNpkmr/8880144555f899b925e339bd6d24a1e1/PCNA18_1837__1_.jpg) \n \n__Base model feels like it:__ Not only did our base tester get pricey, but it still looked like a base model, even after climbing to $81,000. We were hoping for sexier wheels or headlights even, something to give the Cayenne some visual pizzazz to back up its handling credentials and price tag. No dice. It’s the ‘cheap’ version, and you could tell.\n \n---\n \n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n## 5 stars of execution\n \nSafety Features? __YES__\n\n- This was a close call. We liked that all Cayenne models come standard with front and rear parking sensors and a 360-degree camera system, as well as pre-collision alerts and braking.\n\n- But we were disappointed that this Cayenne – at any price – doesn’t come standard with safety tech like adaptive cruise control or lane-keep assist -- instead, these are options or part of option packages. \n  \n- The Cayenne hasn’t yet been crash-tested by NHTSA or IIHS yet though it’s likely that it will get a five-star crash rating from NHTSA and models with optional headlights will get a Top Safety Pick Plus designation from IIHS. \n\n![PCNA18 1855 fine (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6l7GkusxsXOsh8JEquP7j0/19853079d6875fed5d53b09132835d8c/PCNA18_1855_fine__1_.jpg)\n\nValue? __NO__\n\n- As we’ve mentioned, this Cayenne doesn’t pack a punch when it comes to value (though it’s true that most Cayenne buyers aren’t concerned about value).\n\n- Most of its competitors (BMW X5, Mercedes-Benz GLE, Range Rover Velar, and Sport) either offer more content for similar money or a lower sticker price. \n\n\nEfficiency? __NO__\n\n- The base Cayenne we tested was rated by the EPA at 19/23/20 MPG city/highway/combined. \n\n- That’s not great, especially compared to nearly all of its rivals.  \n\n- In our testing, we averaged 16.3 MPG in mixed city and highway driving. \n\n![P17 0774 a5 rgb (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/28zI5YDiCVTAyYc731T5wF/1e962849f85cfb854006366d8021697a/P17_0774_a5_rgb__1_.jpg)\n\nDriving experience? __YES__\n\n- As we’ve mentioned, this was the best part of the Cayenne: that you could have a luxury SUV and a great-handling vehicle in the same package. \n\n- Not only was it sporty and engaging to drive, but it was simultaneously comfortable and serene; too often, performance SUVs make you choose between the two. \n\nExecution? __YES__\n\n- Roughly two decades ago, Porsche’s Cayenne was among the first luxury SUVs to be introduced by a brand known for cars. In the years since, the Cayenne has maintained its benchmark status as the driver’s choice of luxury crossover models. \n\n- It’s thrilling and comfortable to drive on a daily basis, offers a gee-whiz interior and refinement, and is sized right for a wide variety of buyers. \n\n- These strengths make it easier to overlook the aforementioned shortcomings. \n\n\n![PCNA18 1850 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4GEbfZOvaNBIOI3xZ6f9PG/03c66dcdb420edc0305d5f3e96858a91/PCNA18_1850__1_.jpg)\n\n\n\n## Total Rating: 3 stars\n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\n\nAs we mentioned, the Cayenne family includes a wide range of models, both in the standard SUV shape and Porsche’s newer Cayenne Coupe iteration. \n\nWe tested the base Cayenne, which starts at $68,150, including destination. \n\nThis model comes with a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 with 335 horsepower, an eight-speed automatic transmission, and standard all-wheel-drive. Other standard goodies include LED headlights and taillights, 19-inch alloy wheels, a 10-speaker, faux-leather seats, 150-watt stereo system, the aforementioned parking sensors and 360-degree camera system, and automatic emergency braking system with pedestrian detection. \n\n![P17 0782 a5 rgb (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3SmrvfLBVbqr4UlU50GPbW/4b0af5294e78cf628fd041c7094b18df/P17_0782_a5_rgb__1_.jpg)\n\nOur tester then added things like an all-leather interior ($3,750), Porsche’s active suspensions management (PASM -- for $2,000), unique 19-inch wheels ($600), the $1,130 Sport Chrono package (which adds a Sport + vehicle setting, a steering-wheel-mounted button to toggle between drive modes and a Sport Response button that activates a 20-second burst of high-performance settings), and the $6,610 Premium Package (Bose surround sound stereo, 14-way power front seats with memory, panoramic sunroof, lane-change assist, and heated front seats). \n\nAbove the base model we tested sit the following models:\n  \n- The Cayenne E-Hybrid starts at $82,450.\n- The Cayenne S starts at $85,650.\n- The Cayenne Turbo starts at $127,850. \n- The Cayenne Turbo S E-Hybrid starts at 163,250.\n \n---\n\n## Also consider:\n\nThe Cayenne plays in a competitive luxury crossover segment chock full of excellent choices and stiff competition. \n\nSome of our favorites include the sublime Mercedes GLE (best for those prioritizing all-out luxury), the BMW X5 (handles well, but not as good as this Porsche), the Range Rover Velar (small but handsome) and Sport (larger but aging), and Jaguar’s F-Pace (poor reliability but good value).\n\n![PCNA18 1872 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/pc1PeraftukiJo4HbrYl1/3d4081f504f26a3f2da16554242fb5d1/PCNA18_1872__1_.jpg)\n",

      "body": "### Summary\n\nIn production since 1990, the 2019 Hyundai Elantra was updated fairly substantially both inside and out. Part of the sixth generation of the car which debuted in 2017, this year's Elantra received praise from reviewers for its technology, smooth ride, and a lengthy and comprehensive warranty. Some reviewers felt lackluster performance to be a key reason to consider other compact sedans. \n\nSome important new standard features added this year include a rearview camera and 5-inch infotainment display screen. This year's Elantra can be upgraded to include a wireless charging system and a driver drowsiness alert system. \n\nIn 2018, the Elantra GT Hatchback trim was updated to include an additional 4 feet of cargo space as well as an engine with slightly less power than the previous versions. Despite losing 12 HP, that renewed engine is still the second most potent option across all trims of the Elantra. \n\nThe Elantra was comprehensively redesigned in 2017. That update added a new engine for the base trim with similar HP and fuel efficiency when compared to the previous motor. The car also received significant technology and safety updates, including Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, blind spot monitoring, automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control, and forward collision warning. \n\nThose shopping for a used Elantra may be able to save substantially, but models produced before 2017 will not offer the same array of modern features and updates. \n\nA compact sedan, the Elantra finds itself competing against the [Toyota Corolla](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-corolla), [Mazda 3](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-mazda3), and [Honda Civic](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic). \n\nThe Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra are somewhat similar cars, but some key differences stand out to help decide which is a better fit. Those interested in a high-performance variant might be attracted by the 306-horsepower Civic Type-R, which does not have a rival from Hyundai. The Elantra is less expensive than the [Civic](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic), though its cargo space, driver assistance and safety technology are similar. The Elantra has slightly better safety and reliability ratings than a [Honda Civic](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic). \n\nThough the [Toyota Corolla](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-corolla) has long been a popular choice in the compact category, there are some clear reasons why the Elantra may be a better choice. An Elantra is less expensive than a [Corolla](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-corolla), though the Toyota does come with a variety of additional standard safety features. These same features add to the base price of an Elantra. Both are available as hatchbacks for 2019. Many reviewers feel the 2019 Elantra is a slightly better value than a Toyota Corolla. \n\nA [Mazda3](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-mazda3) is one of the top performing compact cars available. It is more expensive but also has a more refined interior when compared to this year's Elantra. While Apple CarPlay is available on most versions of the 3 and the Elantra, Android Auto is unavailable on the Mazda. Many reviewers favored the Mazda if the higher base price is not an issue. \n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Exterior\n\nIn 2019, the Hyundai Elantra saw significant changes to its exterior design. Critical updates to the Elantra's exterior include changes to the headlights which are now more triangular and reconfigured tail lights. \n\n![2019-hyundai-elantra-exterior-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/64OLH4SJa0xQvnlck4MOgl/2ac03ede767a45b589bb12f59f01d3c6/2019-hyundai-elantra-exterior-2.jpg)\n\nFifteen-inch steel wheels with covers are a standard feature on the base level trim. The Eco trim features 15-inch alloy wheels with narrow, low rolling resistance tires. Higher trims receive 16-inch alloy wheels with additional design options. The Elantra Sport trim is the only one to feature 17-inch alloy wheels. \n\n![2019-hyundai-elantra-exterior-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1yWAxwEdqPOzkI9wOGYX6V/849d86aaa7e638d8981dd2a066243aa8/2019-hyundai-elantra-exterior-3.jpg)\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nMost reviewers felt the Hyundai Elantra's interior to be of a sufficient quality that places it among the upper half of the best compact cars available. High-end materials, passenger comfort, and cargo space are key high points for the interior of this car. \n\n![2019-hyundai-elantra-interior-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/45aFden7GpnIsSVO9XEBjK/0bd95a6bc5aa0c008bb877654aea6fb6/2019-hyundai-elantra-interior-1.jpg)\n\n This year's Elantra comfortably sits five passengers in cloth upholstered seats. Upgrades like leather seats, a power adjusted driver's seats, as well as heated and ventilated front seats are possible for additional fees. \n\nReviewers cited the Elantra's driving position to offer good visibility and found the interior to be quiet while driving in the city or on the highway. The front seats are considered spacious and comfortable though taller passengers may wish for more headroom. \n\nThe backseats, which can carry up to five passengers, are a bit cramped and will be tough for a car packed with full-size adults to ride comfortably. Some reviewers felt competitors like the Honda Civic and Nissan Sentra have more space. \n\n![2019-hyundai-elantra-interior-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/79mNE6iMDU6zskkrIzjTMq/39d1300930dd6acb03ec219cf5d9096d/2019-hyundai-elantra-interior-2.jpg)\n\nThe backseat of the Elantra features two sets of LATCH car seat connectors. Reviewers felt they were easy to find and operate. \n\n### Utility & Practicality\n\nProviding 14.4 cubic feet of space in its trunk, the 2019 Hyundai Elantra offers a lot of cargo capacity for a compact sedan. The GT trim adds an additional 24.9 cubic feet of space behind rear seats and over 55.1 cubic feet with the back seats folded down. Split folding rear seats are a standard option on all trim levels. \n\nInside the cabin, the Elantra is loaded with storage capacity. A variety of bins and storage spaces are found throughout the car.  \n\n![2019-hyundai-elantra-exterior-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1KXMEaMaJT0j1esHfN020s/d219fb65826abdf2c2efa7b6fb3aab23/2019-hyundai-elantra-exterior-1.jpg)\n\nThe Hyundai Elantra has a five-year/60,000-mile warranty and a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. This kind of coverage is exceptional when compared to other compact cars in this class. J.D. Power and Associates gave the Elantra a predicted reliability rating of 4 out of 5 stars, better than the average for compact cars, which is 3 out of 5 stars. \n\nReviewers felt features like rear seats which fold totally flat and a hands-free trunk lid opener to be helpful additions that help to improve the utility and practicality of this car. \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Technology & Infotainment\n\nThe Hyundai Elantra can be packed with a variety of high-quality technology and infotainment features which help it to stand out against a crowded pack of small cars. This year's Elantra comes standard with a rearview camera, a six-speaker stereo system, Bluetooth, an infotainment system with a 5-inch screen, and a USB port. \n\nSome available upgrades include dual-zone climate control, a sunroof, push-button start capability, wireless charging stations, navigation, a 7 or 8 inch touch screen, additional USB ports, an 8 inch Infinity stereo system, satellite radio, HD radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Clari Fi music restoration technology, and Hyundai's Blue Link system.  \n\n![2019-hyundai-elantra-interior-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/63l6miFrLJHG3k9ol8w2wB/5a6123a7a64736f8e62f4e279737bee3/2019-hyundai-elantra-interior-3.jpg)\n\nThe Elantra's technology and infotainment offerings help it to compete in the compact car category. Few compact cars offer a better array of technological features than the Elantra. Reviewers felt the Elantra's control systems and button layouts to be intuitive and easy for most passengers to operate. \n\n### Safety & Driving Assistance\n\nThe 2019 Hyundai Elantra was chosen as a Top Safety Pick+ by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Elantra four out of a possible five stars for safety. The NHTSA cited a safety concern with the left rear door of the Elantra during its rigorous side impact crash testing. \n\nThis year's Elantra comes with a rearview camera as a standard feature. It features a wealth of safety and driver assistance technologies such as adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, automatic emergency brakes, pedestrian warnings, driver drowsiness alerts, lane change assistance, rear cross traffic alert and safe exit assistance. A new safety feature,  Safe Exit Assistance, informs Elantra passengers when it is safe to open doors in situations like exiting onto a busy city street. \n\n### Driving Experience\n\nMost reviewers felt the driving experience of the Elantra to be far more utilitarian than thrilling. With engine options ranging from a 147 HP base up to a 201 HP turbo four, the Elantra is not a great choice if high performance is an important quality. \n\nThe Elantra was cited by most reviewers as handling very smooth and reliably. That said, many found that it could not keep pace with competitors such as the Mazda3 or Honda Civic when it comes to the driving experience. \n\nReviewers felt the Elantra's ride excelled at providing a smooth feeling on uneven roads. Large potholes do not feel as significant as they might in other cars. While the Elantra is not as sports orientated as competitors like the Honda Civic or Mazda Mazda3, it offers a smooth and reliable driving experience which is suitable for daily commutes. \n\n### Fuel efficiency\n\nCapable of 28 miles per gallon in the city and 37 miles per gallon on the highway, the Elantra has a fuel efficiency that is about average for compact cars. The Elantra Eco trim receives the best fuel efficiency rating can manage 32 mpg in the city and 40 on the highway. \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Pricing & Value\n\nMost reviewers found the 2019 Hyundai Elantra to offer a tremendous value thanks to its lower-than-average starting price. With the possibility to add many technologies and safety features without reaching the base prices of competitors, the Elantra's value is worth noting. \n\nSome reviewers felt that despite its lower than average price, the Elantra does not offer the performance or refinement found in other similar compact sedans. Still, with the possibility of driving an Elantra GT, drivers who crave a hatchback design with added cargo space to match will want to consider this car. \n\nThe Hyundai Elantra is available in eight possible trims that offer generous potential for customization and upgrade options. The sedan is available in the SE, SEL, Value Edition, Eco, Sport and Limited trims. \n\nThe Hatchback Elantra GT is available in the base and Sport trims. \n\nThe Elantra GT is the best choice for those looking for a bump in performance and cargo space. \n\nThose interested in fuel economy will gravitate towards the Elantra Eco. Those looking for the most features will want to try an Elantra Limited. \n\n__Hyundai Elantra SE__\n\nThe Elantra SE starts at an MSRP of $17,100. It features a 147 HP engine and a six-speed manual transmission. For an additional $1,000, the SE trim can be upgraded to a six-speed automatic transmission. This trim comes with cloth seats, an infotainment system with a 5-inch screen, a rearview camera, a six-speaker stereo system, Bluetooth and a USB port.  \n\n__Hyundai Elantra SEL__\n\nStarting at $19,400, the Hyundai Elantra SEL trim comes with a six-speed automatic transmission as a standard feature. This trim level offers all the same features as the SE with the addition of a driver drowsiness alert system, blind spot monitoring, forward collision warning, lane departure warning, lane keep assist, rear cross traffic alert, and an upgraded infotainment system with a 7 inch touch screen, satellite radio, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. \n\n__Hyundai Elantra Eco__\n\nThe Elantra Eco starts at $20,950. This trim offers a seven-speed dual clutch automatic transmission and a turbocharged 128 HP engine. The Eco trim also features a hands-free trunk release, two additional USB ports, heated front seats and dual-zone climate control. The Hyundai Eco trim is the most fuel-efficient trim available. \n\n__Hyundai Elantra Limited__\n\nPriced at $22,600, the Elantra Limited comes with a six-speed automatic transmission and 147 HP engine. It features leather seats, wireless device charging, power adjustable front seats, an eight-speaker Infinity stereo, ClarFi music restoration technology, and Hyundai's Blue Link telematics system as standard features. ClarFi restores the quality to compressed digital music files, such as those from satellite or streaming services. BlueLink offers a connected car experience which collects and shares data about the Elantra through an application. For an additional $3,350, the Elantra Limited Ultimate package adds adaptive cruise control, an upgraded infotainment system with an 8-inch touchscreen and navigation, automatic emergency braking, a sunroof, pedestrian detection, and safe exit assist. Safe Exit assist informs a passenger when it is safe to exit the vehicle. \n\n__Hyundai Elantra GT__\n\nThe Elantra GT Hatchback starts at an MSRP of $20,000. The more powerful GT Sport starts at $24,000. The Elantra GT comes with a 162 HP four-cylinder engine. The GT Sport has a 201 HP turbo four. The GT Sport has a seven-speed automatic transmission. Each of these Elantra GT models have the same features and upgrades as the Elantra Limited trim with the addition of a substantial amount of cargo space. The GT trim adds an additional 24.9 cubic feet of space behind rear seats and over 55.1 cubic feet with the back seats folded down.\n\n### More Photos\n\nSee more [2019 Hyundai Elantra Photos](https://www.autolist.com/hyundai-elantra-2019/2019-hyundai-elantra-photos).",

      "body": "### Summary\n\nThe Subaru WRX is a compact performance car, aimed at driving enthusiasts who want a little bit of practicality. \n\nIt competes with the likes of the [Volkswagen Golf GTI](https://www.autolist.com/volkswagen-golf+gti) and [Golf R](https://www.autolist.com/volkswagen-golf+r), [VW Jetta GLI](https://www.autolist.com/volkswagen-jetta-gli), [Honda Civic Si](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic-si), Honda Civic Type R and Hyundai Veloster N. All of those are more sporting derivatives of compact cars, and the WRX shares a lot of pieces with the previous generation Subaru Impreza sedan.\n\nWhile the current model was introduced for 2015, features for the 2019 model year Subaru WRX include a limited edition Gray.Series model, an additional five horsepower for STI trims, an upgraded infotainment system and other safety features available across more trim levels.  \n\nThe Subaru WRX has always stood out as one of a kind. There are few all-wheel-drive sedans on the market for less than $50,000 that are purpose-built to provide a performance-oriented driving experience.  \n\nThe WRX is still a Subaru though, and with that, its buyers get all the safety and practicality that Subaru has traditionally provided in their vehicles. The WRX still stands out as an anomaly amongst its peers, offering better performance than most while not being uncomfortable or fussy during the most mundane of daily commutes.  \n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Exterior \n\nThe Subaru WRX looks sporty and athletic.  \n\nIt is low to the ground with its tuned suspension and large wheels separating it from the regular Impreza models. Even the base model has a functional hood scoop, quad exhaust tips, a trunk lid spoiler, and 17-inch wheels.  \n\n![2019-subaru-wrx-exterior-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/53Q8id34TGSmGr6MAtDS41/afa1e0bdfd067778078fbabfacec1ec1/2019-subaru-wrx-exterior-1.jpg)\n\nUpgrading to the STI variants sets the WRX apart even further with the addition of a large rear wing, colored Brembo brake calipers, an even lower suspension, and 19-inch wheels.  \n\nApart from the functional performance features, the WRX still looks like it means business. The relatively sharp front fascia features black grille openings and handsome headlights that don't quite make it look angry, but rather purposeful, and ready for some serious driving.  \n\nThe WRX's styling may be a little boring for some, but its upright roof and windows at least make for a practical interior and better visibility than some coupe-like models. The rear of the WRX is short and verges on being stubby would it not be for the subtle trunk spoiler on the vehicle. Some models get a large, rally-inspired spoiler on the trunk lid to draw attention to the vehicle.\n\n![2019-subaru-wrx-exterior-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5jDjl5BSRVoGN5kuWZYgH7/9208558998d183e43af0f94c3fe71ff1/2019-subaru-wrx-exterior-2.jpg)\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nInterior quality and comfort are noted to be generally good by the WRX's reviewers. Materials are stated to be good but not overly luxurious or high-end. Everything is well made with a lack of loose panels or rattling over bumps, though reviewers observe that rivals from Honda and VW are better appointed inside.\n\n![2019-subaru-wrx-interior-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4gF6eLTL81nsD9NRWiwgbd/9483f10efd111a1ea330bb45b42ea820/2019-subaru-wrx-interior-1.jpg)\n\nSeating comfort is also a high point, according to reviewers. The seats are noted to be well bolstered, and legroom is surprisingly good for the size of the WRX, while headroom is not overly tight. Reviewers state that even larger adults can sit comfortably in the rear seats with an adult driver in an uncompromised seating position.  \n\nThe WRX has good ergonomics according to its testers, with most controls being easily reachable, simple to use and pleasant to the touch.  \n\n![2019-subaru-wrx-interior-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3O0HB1RfM8EiWuh0UZA72D/8d9a507f2fec92fb94d5dcbc4f6e8507/2019-subaru-wrx-interior-2.jpg)\n\nRide quality is observed to be predictably rough for a performance car, especially in the STI model with its firmer suspension. Road noise is universally noted to be one of the low points of the WRX line, revealing its economy roots. Even performance-tuned rivals are better in this regard. \n\n### Utility & Practicality \n\nUtility and practicality are both respectable for the WRX's size. Despite some hatchback rivals, the WRX still offers 12 cubic feet of cargo space with folding rear seats. That is average compared to other sedans in the class, but it again falls short of the more flexible competitors with hatch options. Interior storage is adequate, but not overwhelming, with multiple cupholders and storage pockets.  \n\n![2019-subaru-wrx-exterior-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7gt7rBJfCyD4V1I28iPBWq/f7e4d31850ef33ab00be8485873441ba/2019-subaru-wrx-exterior-3.jpg)\n\nSubaru's standard all-wheel-drive system is still a rarity in this price class. Despite its low ground clearance, the WRX is supremely capable in just about every environment. It won't be able to climb rocks like an SUV, but its rally racing heritage proves that mud, snow and wet conditions. But it's likely better able to keep the car moving quickly through the corners on a track, where front-wheel-drive cars would probably spin their wheels trying to handle a lot of power.  \n\nSubaru also offers a wide variety of roof accessories for extra versatility. Bike racks, cargo boxes, kayak carriers, and other accessories add multiple cargo options for additional storage or adventurous getaways.  \n\n### Technology & Infotainment \n\nSubaru's StarLink infotainment system, with standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, helps the WRX keep up with the competition. A standard 6.5-inch touchscreen display comes with satellite radio, Bluetooth and a 6-speaker audio system that is reported to be underwhelming by reviewers.  \n\n![2019-subaru-wrx-interior-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2SlVSRHrLJsOMajglfkybU/f71a79562b32ef336be310831057f929/2019-subaru-wrx-interior-3.jpg)\n\nAn upgraded StarLink system with a 7-inch touchscreen is optional, in addition to a 9-speaker Harman Kardon stereo system and navigation system. Automatic climate controls, hill start assist and LED high and low beam headlights round out the notable technology features available on WRX.  \n\n### Safety & Driving Assistance\n\nThe 2019 WRX stands out among its peers with its strong crash test ratings.  \n\nThe WRX earns the highest honors from the IIHS with a Top Safety Pick Plus rating. Standard safety equipment on all WRX models includes traction control, electronic stability control, a rearview camera, and brake assist.  \n\nA wide array of safety features are available, but unfortunately, many of these features aren't optional on the base WRX and are only offered on higher WRX trims when paired with the automatic transmission option.  \n\nSubaru's EyeSight safety suite is an option on WRX models with the automatic continuously variable transmission and includes adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, and automatic emergency braking.  \n\nBlind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and StarLink Safety and Security, which include services like theft recovery, roadside assistance, and remote diagnostics, can be added as options. LATCH child safety seat anchors for the rear seats are standard.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nThe Subaru WRX and WRX STI are both built to provide the best driving experience for those who want performance. All engine options are noted to provide best in class performance with nearly unrivaled horsepower numbers for the class.  \n\nThe Subaru WRX is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, which produces 268 horsepower and 258 lb.-ft. of torque. The WRX STI receives a 2.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine with 310 horsepower and 290 lb.-ft. of torque.  \n\nThe WRX receives a standard six-speed manual transmission, or an optional continuously variable transmission. The WRX STI variant is only available with a six-speed manual transmission.  \n\nSpirited driving is aided by superior handling capabilities, according to reviewers. The tuned suspension on the WRX and even stiffer suspension on the WRX STI provides testers with best in class handling around corners. Most reviewers note that, even though the suspension stiffness makes for a rough ride, many of the WRX's buyers will be willing to sacrifice comfort for performance.  Steering is tight and responsive while the clutch in manual transmission cars is heavy and can be tiring, according to testers.  \n\nAcceleration is best in class, with the all-wheel-drive system providing additional grip from a stop. 0-60 mph times are 5.4 seconds for the WRX and 4.5 seconds for the WRX STI.  \n\nBraking is noted to be slightly underwhelming by reviewers with merely adequate pedal feel. Adding to the overall driving experience is the pleasant burble of the \"boxer\" engine, according to testers. A tuned exhaust is available as a dealer option for the WRX for an even more prominent exhaust note.  \n\n### Fuel Efficiency \n\nFuel economy is where the WRX suffers the most compared with others in its class. It trails performance competitors like the Honda Civic Type R and [Golf GTI](https://www.autolist.com/volkswagen-golf+gti) by a significant margin, partly because of the standard all-wheel-drive.  \n\nThe WRX receives an EPA-estimated 21 miles per gallon in the city and 27 mpg highway when equipped with the manual transmission. The automatic falls behind even more, at 18 city and 24 highway. The more powerful STI returns an EPA-estimated 17 mpg in city driving and up to 22 mpg on the highway.\n\nThe [Golf GTI](https://www.autolist.com/volkswagen-golf+gti), with its 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, returns an EPA estimated 24 and 32 mpg in city and highway driving, respectively. A Civic Type R, with 306 horsepower, gets an EPA-estimated 22 city and 28 highway, which still bests the WRX by a combined one mile per gallon.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Pricing & Value  \n\nThe Subaru WRX presents various value propositions depending on its buyer.  \n\nIf high performance is a top priority, the WRX is unrivaled. Those who value sports car handling will understand that a stiff suspension is a fair tradeoff for cornering capability and spirited driving experience.  \n\nAdditionally, Subaru's excellent all-wheel-drive system helps put the power to the pavement or the dirt. Both engines are supremely capable and provide brisk enough acceleration for a performance vehicle, let alone a daily commuter.  \n\nThe WRX will not present a good value if the latest technology, safety equipment, ride comfort, and gas mileage are top priorities.  \n\nFuel efficiency is at the bottom of the class. The sport-tuned suspension offers a harsh ride despite the seats reportedly being very comfortable. Standard safety equipment, which is standard on many other vehicles, is only optional on the WRX, and technology is just average. \n\nThe Subaru WRX is available in five different trim options:  \n\n__Subaru WRX Base __\n\nThe standard WRX model comes standard with the 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine and starts at around $28,000 with destination fee included. A 6-speed manual transmission is the only transmission on this version.  \n\nSeventeen-inch alloy wheels, manual front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, rearview camera, automatic climate control, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, Bluetooth, satellite radio and performance tires are standard. Notable technology features include Subaru's StarLink infotainment system with a 6.5-inch touchscreen display and hill start assist.  \n\n__Subaru WRX Premium __\n\nThe WRX Premium starts at around $30,400 with destination included. The manual transmission is standard, but a CVT automatic transmission is optional for an additional $1,900.  \n\nOther features on this version include an upgraded 7-inch touchscreen display, power sunroof, heated front seats, fog lights and 18-inch wheels.  \n\nOpting for the continuously variable transmission also adds Subaru's EyeSight safety suite, which includes automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control, among other safety technologies. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are optional extras regardless of the selected transmission.  \n\nManual transmission cars can be equipped with the Performance Package which includes Recaro seats, and larger brake pads and calipers. The sunroof is removed if this package is selected. Also available on the Premium is the Series.Gray package. With it comes blacked-out 18-inch wheels, LED headlights and foglights and a special gray paint scheme, from which it gets its name.  \n\n__Subaru WRX Limited__\n\nThe Limited trim starts at just under $32,700 with destination included, and the automatic transmission is available for an additional $1,900.\n\nThe Limited comes standard with the painted, larger brakes offered on the Premium Series.Gray sub-trim, and adds leather upholstery, power driver's seat, push-button start and navigation.  A 9-speaker Harman Kardon stereo system and upgraded StarLink infotainment system are both options for the Limited.  \n\n__Subaru WRX STI __\n\nThe Subaru WRX STI comes with the larger 2.5-liter turbo engine, comes only with a manual transmission, and starts at $37,500 with destination charge included.  \n\nNineteen-inch wheels, performance tires, full HID headlights, Brembo brakes, partial leather seating, upgraded tuned suspension, and front, rear and adjustable center differential are all standard.  \n\nRecaro sports seats, push-button start and a power adjustable driver's seat are optional. The Series.Gray sub-trim is also optional with everything from the WRX Premium and the addition of Bilstein dampers for even more improved handling.  \n\n__Subaru WRX STI Limited__\n\nThe WRX STI Limited is the highest trim option available on the WRX STI and starts at $42,280. The STI Limited comes standard with every feature on each trim below it with the opportunity to replace the large rear wing with a smaller lip spoiler at no extra cost.\n\n### More Photos\n\nSee more [2019 Subaru WRX Photos](https://www.autolist.com/subaru-impreza+wrx-2019/2019-subaru-wrx-photos).",

      "body": "Autolist rating: __4/5__\nBut would we buy it? __Yep!__\nPrice range: __$18,470 - $23,170__, including destination but before options\n\n---\n\n## Key takeaways\n- The Venue is a brand-new model for Hyundai in 2020.\n\n- A six-speed manual transmission is standard, but an “intelligent” CVT is optional.\n\n- One engine is available for all models.\n\n- An eight-inch touchscreen is standard, and as is  Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\n- The Venue comes in front-wheel drive only, but it does have  different drive modes for traction in bad weather or on rougher terrain.\n\n![Large-36132-2020Venue (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4j5RB4fcFufkbOdE18PDPu/27cd277c49e8867bf587f76f5e66b02e/Large-36132-2020Venue__1_.jpg) \n\n\n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n## What is it?\n\nThe Hyundai Venue is brand new for the 2020 model year. As a subcompact crossover, it competes in a crowded segment that includes the Nissan Kicks, Toyota CH-R, and Honda HR-V. \n\nThe lineup is powered by a single engine: A 1.6-liter dual-port injection four-cylinder that comes paired with a six-speed manual transmission as standard equipment. Buyers can upgrade to a continuously variable transmission with unique software that helps it shift and behave much more like a normal automatic gearbox.\n\nThe Venue comes in three trims: SE, SEL, and Denim. \n\nWithin the Hyundai lineup, the Venue is the smallest crossover, sitting below the Kona, Tucson, Santa Fe, Santa Fe XL, and Palisade in size and pricing.\n\n![Large-39992-2020Venue-Miami (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4uuNNz9BZ2XdrV3FZ4GtJm/8e4595b6bef10fdae1d255f341d86aad/Large-39992-2020Venue-Miami__1_.jpg) \n\nHyundai says that the Venue is designed for young urban professionals that want to shop for a new car but have a limited budget. Its starting price of just $17,350 includes a long list of standard tech and comfort features, and the vehicle can be equipped with several advanced driver assistance features (ADAS). \n\nThe crossover is also capable of using Hyundai’s BlueLink feature, which allows owners to remotely start, lock, and interact with their Venues from a smartphone.\n\n\n---\n\n## What’s good?\n*TLDR: The new Hyundai Venue packs strong value, handsome styling, and a comfortable ride into a tide subcompact package.*\n\n__Value:__ Though Hyundai and Kia have spent a large chunk of the last two decades trying to shed their budget car images, the Venue shows the brands’ strengths in the affordable car arena. With a starting price of $17,350 before destination, the Venue has a strong warranty and a decent list of standard features that make it an appealing choice for someone on the fence between a new and used vehicle.\n\n __Handsome:__ Styling is subjective, but Hyundai gave the Venue a grown-up design that mirrors the brand’s flagship SUVs like the Palisade. A large grille and the upright profile make the tiny crossover appear sophisticated and more imposing than it actually is, and the rectangular LED running lights are reminiscent of the Kia Telluride’s lighting.\n\n![Large-36133-2020Venue (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/79RajGeFx4xiFPRXvgTgv0/23722151fc4d40441e879a4798eea70b/Large-36133-2020Venue__1_.jpg) \n\n__Comfort:__ The Venue is small enough that it’s as much of a lifted hatchback as it is an actual crossover. That’s ok, though, because inside there’s enough room for four people, though the front seat passengers get the best seats in the house. The front buckets are wide and well-padded, though better lumbar support and a few more degrees of adjustment for the seat bottom would help a wider variety of drivers find their ideal driving position.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n## What’s bad?\n\n*TLDR: The Venue’s great fuel economy comes at the expense of power, it’s noisy on the highway, and the driver assistance systems can be aggressive at times.*\n\n__Underpowered:__ The Venue is wonderfully fuel-efficient, but the benefits of being a fuel sipper come at the expense of  power. The 1.6-liter engine makes 121 horsepower and 113 lb-ft of torque, which isn’t enough for the Venue, despite its small size. \n\nGetting up to highway speeds and passing both take a bit of extra planning, as the Venue isn’t going anywhere in a hurry. We tested the CVT models and did not have an opportunity to test the 6-speed manual model, which may help improve acceleration a little.\n\n__Noisy:__ Cabin noise, especially on the highway, is very noticeable in the Venue. Gaps and imperfections in the pavement make themselves known, and wind noises are front and center at higher speeds. Around town and at low speeds, the sound level is much more tolerable. The Venue’s engine also makes a lot of noise under full throttle without doing much actual acceleration.\n\n![Large-39993-2020Venue-Miami (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/45J0kvYIdayFUKtm3vusjh/a8432cdfef3bd815c16ad0e24dd42175/Large-39993-2020Venue-Miami__1_.jpg) \n\n__Electronic nannies:__ The benefits of having driver aids far outweighs and adjustment periods or annoyances with using them, but the lane-keeping assist system in the Venue can catch drivers off guard if they aren’t expecting it. On curvy portions of the road, like a highway off-ramp, the system will attempt to correct the steering wheel, no matter the speed of the vehicle. This can make it feel like the car is trying to steer itself off the road when in reality it’s just trying to stay between the lines. This is more of an annoyance than an actual danger, but the aggressiveness of the steering correction can be frightening if the driver is not aware that it’s coming.\n\n\n---\n\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n## 5 stars of execution\n\nSafety Features? __YES__\n- The Venue’s strong list of standard advanced safety features makes it worth a look on its own. They include forward-collision warnings, pedestrian detection, lane-keep assist, and a driver attention warning.\n\n- Higher trims come with blind-spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alerts, and LED lighting for better visibility.\n\n- The most prominent gripe about safety features in the Venue is the aggressive lane-keep assist system.\n\n- The Venue has not yet been rated by the IIHS or NHTSA.\n\nValue? __YES__\n- The Venue’s starting price of $17,350 brings with it a long list of standard tech, comfort, and safety features.\n\n- Hyundai’s starting prices undercut those from Nissan, Toyota, and Honda, while offering a similar list of features.\n\n- This value should help the Venue lure in buyers who were thinking they couldn’t afford a new car and had to buy used. \n\n![Large-39995-2020Venue-Miami (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2tMedwbZstVTOwskW5UCO/4ce7fd0756694b34026c5f119adf3fbb/Large-39995-2020Venue-Miami__1_.jpg)\n\n\nEfficiency? __YES__\n- Hyundai claims fuel economy ratings of 27/35/30 mpg city/highway/combined for the SE model and 30/34/32 mpg city/highway/combined for the SEL and Denim models.\n\n- Those figures are higher than many of the Venue’s subcompact crossover competitors. \n\n- No hybrid or plug-in hybrid variants are available right now. \n\n\n\nDriving experience? __No__ \n\n- As an urban commuter, the Venue is perfect, but the driving experience is not a memorable one.\n\n- The 1.6-liter engine has to work hard to get the Venue up to speed.\n\n- The good news is that the Venue’s CVT transmission feels and behaves more predictably than a standard CVT, and avoids all of the whining, droning sounds that typically come from the gearboxes.\n\nExecution? __YES__\n\n- The Venue’s interior and exterior finishes are excellent, especially considering the price.\n\n- Interior styling is attractive, and most controls, buttons, and functions are placed well within reach of the driver.\n\n- Overall, it’s a well-thought-out entrant in the subcompact crossover space, one that will appeal to a wide variety of shoppers.\n\n\n\n##  Total Rating:  4 stars\n\n![Large-39998-2020Venue-Miami (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3guzg8JTSoyhyAmNzC7PYn/7201ed19403e4070f080afaa2716d301/Large-39998-2020Venue-Miami__1_.jpg) \n\n\n\n--- \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\n\nThe base Hyundai __Venue SE__ starts at $18,470 after a $1,120 destination/freight charge, and comes with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, a six-speed manual transmission, 15-inch wheels, cloth upholstery, Bluetooth, an 8-inch infotainment screen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, steering-wheel controls, folding rear seats, automatic headlights, power windows and door locks, forward-collision avoidance with pedestrian detection, lane-keep assist, a driver-attention warning system, a rearview monitor, and a four-speaker audio system.\n\nThe Venue SE can be upgraded to an automatic/IVT transmission for $1,200.\n\nThe __Venue SEL__ has a starting price of $19,670 after the $1,120 destination charge, and comes standard with the CVT transmission, selectable driving modes, automatic climate controls, dual USB ports, a center console with armrest, roof rails, and a six-speaker sound system.\n\nA convenience package is available for $1,150 that includes a power sunroof, sliding center armrest, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alerts.\n\nA Premium Package is available that comes with LED headlights and running lights, LED taillights, 17-inch wheels, a proximity key with push-button start, a navigation system, and Hyundai Blue Link.\n\n![Large-36146-2020Venue (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6r3AwRRR3dufTz3JacuR5q/f4631b818e70ca68ff4676fffac47af5/Large-36146-2020Venue__1_.jpg) \n\n\nThe __Venue Denim__ starts at $23,170 after the $1,120 destination fee, and comes with an exclusive Denim paint color, contrasting white roof paint, upgraded interior fabrics with leatherette accents, and a sunroof delete.\n\nThe __Denim__ trim’s paint and interior colors are attractive and upscale, but __if it were our money, we’d buy the SEL__ trim with an added Premium Package. This brings all of the safety features and adds a sunroof, while avoiding the Denim’s price bump.\n\n\n---\n\n## Also consider:\n\nThe subcompact crossover segment is as hot as it gets right now, as every major automaker has dipped their toe into the water in the past few years.\n\nThe __Toyota CH-R__ is a funky but popular crossover that comes in front-wheel-drive only, just like the Venue. Its back seat and cargo space are cramped, but its expected reliability is excellent and the driving experience is lively and engaging.\n\nThe __Honda HR-V__ packs in great cargo space, comfortable seats, and is one of the only vehicles in the segment with available all-wheel drive. It is pricier than the Venue by at least $3,000 in the lowest trim level.\n\nThe __Nissan Kicks__ packs attractive styling and an engaging driving experience into a very small package. It’s also got stellar fuel economy ratings, hitting 36 mpg on the highway. The Kicks’ price tag is slightly higher than the Venue’s starting at around $19,000.\n\nWe'd avoid others in the segment, like the __Ford EcoSport__, which are built on aging platforms and need a tech overhaul.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "To save money when buying your next vehicle, consider buying it in a state that doesn't charge sales tax. There are more than a handful of states with no sales tax on cars. If you live somewhere like New Mexico or New Hampshire and buy a car or SUV there, you won't have to pay any sales tax on it. If your state charges sales tax, a trip across a state line to a place that doesn't tax you for your purchase might be worthwhile.\n\n### What Is a Sales Tax?\n\nA sales tax is an amount of money state and local governments require sellers to collect when they sell goods or services. Sales taxes differ from excise taxes, which are flat-rate taxes you pay when you buy something such as motor vehicle fuel, or the materials to make a product. To compute state sales taxes on motor vehicles in most states, multiply the purchase price of the vehicle by the tax rate that applies. Typically, the more money a vehicle costs, the more sales tax a buyer pays. If a vehicle sales tax applies, the vehicle seller must collect the tax when the sale transaction occurs. \n\nAlaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon don't impose any direct state sales taxes, as of 2020, while New Mexico charges sales taxes, but not on cars. \n\nHowever, even states that don't charge a direct sales tax on a vehicle may charge a registration, document, or use tax when you go to register the vehicle. These states may also charge a tax on vehicles bought out of state or bought from dealers out of state. \n\nAdditionally, Oregon charges its dealers a vehicle privilege tax of .005% of the retail price of a new vehicle that has less than 7,500 miles on it; this tax is usually passed on to the buyer. \n\n### State and Local Sales Taxes Can Be Charged\n\nMany states that charge sales taxes at the state level also allow their local governments to impose sales and use taxes. The result is that you might pay more in taxes for the same vehicle at the same sales price, depending on the city or county of the state in which you buy the car. \n\nFor example, in New York, the state sales tax rate is 4%, but county and local taxes can boost the rate up to 4.5% more. In other words, you might pay a tax rate between 4% and 8.5% for the same car at the same sales price. The good news for consumers is that New York limits its vehicle sales tax to a maximum of $725. A trip to Delaware or New Hampshire might mean no sales tax at purchase time.\n\n### States With No Sales Tax on Cars\n\nIf you don't live in or near New Hampshire, Delaware, Montana, Oregon, Alaska, or New Mexico, other states offer the opportunity to buy a vehicle without paying sales tax. Buy a car in Maryland, North Carolina, Iowa, or South Dakota, and you might be able to skip the cost of sales tax on your Ford, Chevy, or Subaru. Washington, D.C. doesn't charge sales tax on cars, either. However, some of these states charge use taxes, which serve the same purpose as sales taxes.\n\n### Florida Laws Benefit Buyers From States Without Sales Tax\n\nPeople who live in states that don't charge sales tax on used or new cars can use their home state's tax laws to their advantage in Florida. Under Florida law, out-of-state residents who buy used or new cars in the Sunshine State get a partial exemption of sales and use taxes. Florida only collects sales tax in the amount that purchasers would pay in their home states. This tax policy means residents of New Hampshire, Delaware, Montana, Oregon, Alaska, and New Mexico, who find and buy their dream cars in Florida don't pay sales or use taxes in Florida. \n\nWhen buying cars in Florida, Alabama residents pay only 2%, and Colorado residents pay 2.9%, their state's respective sales tax rates. Hawaii and Wyoming residents pay 4%, and Louisiana residents pay 5%. If you live in a state with a sales tax rate higher than Florida, such as New Jersey, California, and Tennessee, Florida gives you a partial exemption. The result? You pay a maximum of 6%, Florida's state sales tax rate, which saves money for you.  \n\n### No Florida Exemption for Certain States\n\nResidents of Arkansas, Mississippi, and West Virginia who buy cars in Florida must pay motor vehicle sales tax to their government because their states don't give credit for taxes paid to the state. Florida's state sales tax policies mean buyers get taxed twice for their motor vehicle purchases. These out-of-state residents end up paying tax in Florida at the sale and paying again in their home states when they license their vehicles at the DMV.\n\n### How to Claim the Florida Sales Tax Exemption\n\nNonresident buyers must apply for their exemption when the sale occurs. Whether the transaction is through a dealer or a private individual, the buyer must fill out and submit Form DR-123, Affidavit for Partial Exemption of Motor Vehicle Sold for Licensing in Another State. This form states the buyer's intent to license the purchased vehicle in their home state within 45 days of the purchase date. If the sale is through a dealer, the buyer gives the form to the dealer. In a private sale transaction, the buyer provides the exemption form to the private tag agent or tax collector when purchasing the vehicle's temporary tag. \n\n### Michigan's Sales Tax Exemptions Similar to Florida's\n\nAs a general rule, if you live out of state, buy a car in Michigan, and take delivery there, you must pay sales tax in Michigan. However, if you have the dealer or seller ship or deliver your car to a location outside the state, then no sales tax is due back to Michigan. For example, if you live in Illinois, Indiana, or Minnesota, buy a car in Michigan, and have the seller or dealer deliver it to your home state, you won't pay any sales tax in Michigan. But if you decide to drive the car home to Illinois, Indiana, or Minnesota, the dealer must charge you sales tax in Michigan.\n\nLike Florida, Michigan exempts out-of-state car buyers from sales tax when their home state has no sales tax on cars. So if you buy a Ford F-150, Chevy Tahoe, or Honda Civic in Michigan, but plan on titling and registering it in one of the sales tax-free states - such as Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon, or New Mexico – the state of Michigan exempts your vehicle from its sales tax. \n\nMichigan also exempts residents of the District of Columbia and ten non-reciprocal states from sales taxation. In the West, these states are Oklahoma, Arkansas, West Virginia, South Dakota, and Nebraska. In the East, they include North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, and Maryland. Because these states impose a use tax, which serves the same purpose as a sales tax, Michigan allows exemptions to protect purchasers from being taxed twice for a single sales transaction. \n\nBuying your new car is a significant event and is one of the most expensive and longest-term purchases many people make. Therefore, it's worth spending some extra time searching for ways to save some money – a lot of money, in some cases. If you live in or near one of the states with no sales tax on cars, take full advantage of your money-saving position. Do your research, find the vehicle you want, and make your best deal. Then, congratulate yourself on how much you saved by being in the right place at the right time.",

      "body": "The 2020 CLA is the second generation of Mercedes' compact four-door  car that mimics larger sporty coupes, but with the benefit of two additional doors and a lower starting price. It competes most directly with compact four-door sedans including the [Acura ILX](https://www.autolist.com/acura-ilx), [Audi A3](https://www.autolist.com/audi-a3), Cadillac CT4, Mercedes' own [A-Class](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-a+class) sedan, as well as the two-door [BMW 2 Series](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-2+series) Coupe and upcoming four-door [BMW 2 Series](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-2+series) Gran Coupe. \n\nThe Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class has been redesigned for 2020, inheriting many of the design touches and technology from the more upright A-Class sedan. That includes the prominent MBUX infotainment technology, which features two TFT displays in place of physical dials, and offers things such as augmented reality navigation.\n\nThe CLA 250 is also about $4,000 more expensive than the A 220 sedan, starting at $37,645, although it does have more standard horsepower. And there are high-performance AMG versions for those looking for a compact Mercedes with more vigor. That gives the 2020 Mercedes CLA one of the broadest lineups among compact luxury cars.\n\n### Pros:\n\n- Striking styling inside and out.\n- More extensive interior technology.\n- Numerous performance derivatives.\n\n### Cons:\n\n- Controls can be complex.\n- Styling impacts practicality.\n- More expensive than similar Mercedes A-Class.\n\n### Exterior\n\nTL;DR: The CLA cuts a more dashing look than the A-Class and looks like a mini CLS.\n\nThe CLA’s main draw is its styling. When compared to compact sedans, even Mercedes’ own [A-Class](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-a+class), it is decidedly more sporty and coupe-like (Mercedes likes to call it a “four-door coupe”). The [Acura ILX](https://www.autolist.com/acura-ilx) and [Audi A3](https://www.autolist.com/audi-a3) are traditionally upright, and the Cadillac CT4 only slightly less so. Even the [BMW 2](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-2+series) Series Coupe is arguably more traditional looking than the CLA. Only the [BMW 2](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-2+series) Series Gran Coupe does anything similar, also described as a “four-door coupe.” \n\n![2020-mercedes-cla-exterior-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3ANbjMnxojRBjjQImojB5n/f8b43e2971591232875797f78fc67155/2020-mercedes-cla-exterior-1.jpg)\n\nTo some, the CLA invokes strong images of the larger and more prestigious Mercedes CLS-Class, with its frameless side glass on the doors and sharply sloping roof. There are even noticeable echoes of them in the front, side, and rear. The prominent Mercedes emblem in the back even serves as the way to open the trunk from the outside. Standard LED lights also add some nighttime jewelry to the look.\n\nAnd compared to the previous model, the CLA is arguably more like the CLS in terms of detailing, with a smoother appearance and more refined overall profile that reviewers seem to prefer. Some of the increased elegance might be attributed to the additional two inches in length and width, which helps give the new CLA a more significant presence than the outgoing car. That width also sets it apart from the [A-Class](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-a+class) sedan, making it look a little more expensive (which it is).\n\n![2020-mercedes-cla-exterior-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4XJu65TTvgrNlhHMWN6fNk/01b4199f4cb78cc02992d6ae08a723f8/2020-mercedes-cla-exterior-2.jpg)\n\nFor those who want four doors but don’t want to exude a practical nature, the CLA’s fetching looks may seal the deal.\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior\n\nTL;DR: Emphasis on style extends inside into a somewhat intimate cabin.\n\nCoupes are typically image-driven, and even though the CLA has four doors, the style and detailing that makes the exterior special is also evident inside. \n\n![2020-mercedes-cla-interior-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/682BGQ8TfBvjcinsOTA7zo/20e2348e87818650cde7b61775e11787/2020-mercedes-cla-interior-1.jpg)\n\nMuch of the interior is borrowed from the [A-Class](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-a+class) sedan. However, the 2020 CLA’s cockpit is much improved over the outgoing model’s. It’s no longer Mercedes-Benz’s least expensive model, and that’s evident from first impressions. Materials are generally regarded by reviewers as on par with more expensive Mercedes cars, however. The CLA features the same turbine-style air vents as the [A-Class](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-a+class), even though some pieces are painted hard plastics rather than metal or wood. Overall, though, many other pieces of switchgear having the same heft as the [C](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-c+class) or even [E](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-e+class) classes.\n\nYet compared to the [A-Class](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-a+class), the CLA’s interior feels a little more aggressive. That’s mostly the product of different seats and shorter windows that are the result of its sloping roofline. At least a standard panoramic roof helps relieve claustrophobia. But otherwise, features and quality are about the same. Most models will be dominated by two 10.5-inch TFT displays (seven-inch ones are standard). One of these sits in front of the driver to display speed and vehicle information. The one in the center of the dashboard handles all infotainment functions. With an available 64-color ambient lighting system, Mercedes has managed a modern atmosphere that is far removed from its larger and arguably more stodgy models. Heated and cooled front seats are also available to improve perceived comfort and quality.\n\n![2020-mercedes-cla-interior-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3FD1WEbHCQQGvqc1Bs2aWu/b9de0ed7954ca37a44686f6620b6f2a9/2020-mercedes-cla-interior-2.jpg)\n\nBy comparison, the Acura, Audi, and BMW have had the same interior designs for several years now and feature smaller infotainment screens. At least Audi brought in the digital gauges from more expensive models.\n\nJust like the outside, for those who prioritize style, the CLA may be the winner in the interior stakes.\n\n### Utility & Practicality\n\nTL;DR: Give up practicality, gain style.\n\nOne of the biggest attractions of a coupe can also lead to one of its biggest shortcomings. That sloping roof may look cool from the outside, but can seriously impact headroom inside, especially for taller passengers. The 2020 CLA largely escapes this, however.\n\nOn the space front, the headroom is regarded as a significant improvement over the previous CLA, especially for rear passengers. Testers approaching six-feet-tall find the headliner brushes their hair, but there is reportedly enough legroom to slump down a little. And the added width helps make things a little airier for four passengers. While there is a fifth seatbelt, don’t expect to seat three adults across the back seat without lots of fidgeting. \n\n![2020-mercedes-cla-exterior-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7bqzHVMoRkck7unPBPQAmC/d34117c310660e6a66b1826d56ea7769/2020-mercedes-cla-exterior-3.jpg)\n\nFront space is almost as good as in the similar [A-Class](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-a+class) sedan except for the loss of headroom. Ultimately, count on the CLA being slightly more snug than a traditional sedan like the [A3](https://www.autolist.com/audi-a3), CT4, or [ILX](https://www.autolist.com/acura-ilx). But having four doors makes it better at accessing the rear seat than the [BMW 2 Series](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-2+series) Coupe, for example. The 2 Series Gran Coupe will have a similar layout as the CLA.\n\nMercedes-Benz has not published official trunk capacity figures for the 2020 CLA but told reviewers it’s slightly less than last year’s 13.1 cubic feet. Still, the A3 only holds ten cubic feet and even the two-door 2 Series Coupe nearly 14. Only the CT4’s 10.7 cubic feet seems especially paltry in this class. The [A3](https://www.autolist.com/audi-a3) and [2 Series](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-2+series) Coupe have relatively square opening and shape for the cargo area, while the CLA’s aggressive styling makes it more difficult to access the space and load a tall object inside.\n\n### Infotainment & Technology\n\nTL;DR: Technology will dazzle passengers, possibly confuse drivers\n\nLike several new Mercedes vehicles, in-car technology is a centerpiece of the CLA’s interior. Yet like those new vehicles, it may be overwhelming to some drivers. At least passengers might be impressed.\n\nThe 2020 CLA is the latest Mercedes model to use the company’s newest infotainment system, called MBUX. It effectively connects the two TFT screens in the cabin to control vehicle, audio, navigation, and ventilation functions. A touchpad in the center console can navigate through the features, but you can also touch the center display or use two touch-sensitive pads on the steering wheel. Or you could also use Mercedes’ new voice assistant to change the temperature, for example, by saying, “Hey Mercedes.” \n\n![2020-mercedes-cla-interior-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6E3PWg9xfOIpNzsSqDaXWU/ff08758d4b84cb623e20793db8c02a61/2020-mercedes-cla-interior-3.jpg)\n\nWhile all of this sounds technically amazing, several reviewers found it complicated to do simple functions such as changing a radio station, and that none of the controls worked smoothly. At least there are physical buttons for some functions such as heating and cooling. And the screens themselves, especially with the optional 10.25-inch displays, are of high resolution (seven-inch units are standard). \n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, but the CLA comes only with three USB-C ports. Depending on their phones, buyers may need to invest in some adapters to connect their devices.\n\nMajor tech options include augmented reality for the navigation system to see precisely the intersection or destination that you should look out for. Those directions can also be shown on an optional head-up display. \n\nAnd this Mercedes has more comprehensive technology than the comparatively old designs of the [ILX ](https://www.autolist.com/acura-ilx)and [2 Series](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-2+series) Coupe, while the [A3](https://www.autolist.com/audi-a3) is also feeling its age. Its primary competition for technology likely comes from the new 2 Series Gran Coupe and CT4.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Safety\n\nTL;DR: More standard technology than last year is good, but many features remain optional.\n\nThe 2020 CLA is updated with numerous driver assistance technologies from larger Mercedes models, including an advanced system that can perform modest steering inputs. But these will be options when less expensive mainstream models make them standard.\n\nEvery CLA now gets automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, an attention-monitoring system for the driver to detect drowsiness and crosswind assist. \n\nOptions include active LED headlamps, blind-spot monitoring, and a 360-degree camera. A comprehensive option package includes adaptive cruise control with high-speed emergency braking, active lane-keep assist, active blind-spot monitoring, and a lane change assist. \n\nThe navigation system can also be equipped with a speed-based re-routing system. \n\nThe active steering assist can make steering corrections, but the driver cannot keep their hands off the wheel for more than a few seconds. However, Mercedes says the system uses cameras and radars to monitor the road up to 1,640 feet ahead of the vehicle.\n\nIn contrast, the [Acura ILX](https://www.autolist.com/acura-ilx) makes adaptive cruise control and active lane-keep assist standard on all models – and that car starts at roughly $10,000 less than the Mercedes. The Cadillac CT4 will get the company’s lauded Super Cruise driver assistance system in 2020, which can make hands-free lane changes on highways in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nNeither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, have posted test results for the 2020 CLA.\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nTL;DR: CLA is more refined than before, more aggressive than sedan sibling.\n\nThe CLA doesn’t just look more sporting than the A-Class; it has the power to back it up. Not only is the standard version more powerful than before, but there are two performance-oriented models with high-performance numbers to match.\n\nThe CLA 250 comes with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with 221 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. Power is up 13 over the 2019 CLA 250, and 33 over the A 220 sedan. The only transmission available with this engine is a 7-speed dual-clutch automated transmission. Mercedes estimates the CLA 250 gets from 0 to 60 mph in 6.3 seconds, even with optional all-wheel-drive.\n\nThe Mercedes-AMG CLA 35 is equipped with a 302-horsepower version of the engine, with 295 pound-feet of torque and a manufacturer-estimated 0-60 mph time of 4.6 seconds. And the CLA 45 goes even further with 362 horsepower and 354 pound-feet of torque, with Mercedes estimating a 4-second 0-60 time – along with the promise of a top speed of 155 mph.\n\nAs far as the way the standard CLA 250 drives, reviewers say it feels more athletic and taut than the A 220, as well as more composed and substantial that the previous CLA 250. The engine provides strong power from the start and quickly gets up to highway speeds (and then some). However, some say the transmission suffers from hesitant shifts at low speeds and that it isn’t as smooth as some of the company’s traditional automatic transmissions. \n\nIn this company, the rear-wheel-drive [BMW 2 Series](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-2+series) Coupe and Cadillac CT4 may offer more rewarding driving experiences, especially to those used to Mercedes’ rear-wheel-drive models such as the C-Class. Opting for the CLA’s all-wheel-drive system (standard on the AMG CLA 35 and CLA 45 models) could be a fix.\n\nStill, the CLA will likely be a satisfying drive for most buyers looking for Mercedes virtues in a smaller package that feels more youthful.\n\n### Fuel Efficiency\n\nTL;DR: Fuel economy estimates show the CLA is just as efficient as less powerful rivals.\n\nThe EPA estimates the 2020 CLA 250 will achieve 25 mpg city, 35 highway, and 28 in combined city/highway driving. The all-wheel-drive CLA 250 4Matic is rated at 23 city, 33 highway and 27 combined. Estimates for the CLA 35 and CLA 45 are not yet available.\n\nThe less powerful A 220 models achieve 28 mpg combined, with roughly the same city and highway estimates, so there’s no benefit in going for fewer horsepower in this case. The CLA’s superior aerodynamics likely are at play there.\n\nBy comparison, a front-wheel-drive [Audi A3](https://www.autolist.com/audi-a3) achieves a marginally better 26 mpg city, 35 highway and 29 combined. But opt for the more powerful and all-wheel-drive [A3](https://www.autolist.com/audi-a3), and the numbers drop to 22 city, 30 highway and 25 combined. The far less powerful [Acura ILX](https://www.autolist.com/acura-ilx) is no better than the CLA 250, either, at 28 mpg combined, and the [BMW 230i](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-2+series) Coupe is at 27.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Trim Level and Pricing\n\nThe 2020 CLA is available in three versions with various levels of performance. \n\nThe __CLA 250__ starts from $37,645, including a $995 destination charge. The 4Matic all-wheel-drive version starts from $39,645. A 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with 221 horsepower and 7-speed dual-clutch transmission is the only powertrain. \n\nStandard equipment includes LED headlamps and taillights, panoramic roof, 18-inch wheels, and the MBUX infotainment system with two 7-inch displays – including a touchscreen for media functions. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with smartphone integration are also standard. Significant options include leather upholstery, a 64-color ambient lighting system, the 10.25-inch digital displays, navigation package with augmented reality, blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise with active driver assistance technologies, Burmester audio system and various wheel and trim packages.\n\nThe __Mercedes-AMG CLA 35__ is the first performance trim. It starts with a 302-horsepower version of the CLA 250’s engine, along with standard all-wheel-drive. The CLA 35 gets a distinctive hood design, as well as changes to the front and rear bumpers and a rear spoiler. Inside, the 64-color ambient lighting system is standard, along with the 10.25-inch displays for the infotainment system. The infotainment system also includes special readouts for track times. Options are similar to those on the CLA 250, including 19-inch wheels and sport seats with Dinamica inserts. Prices for the CLA 35 are not yet available.\n\nFinally, the __Mercedes-AMG CLA 45__ offers the most performance in the CLA. It comes with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with 362 horsepower and 354 pound-feet of torque, along with a more aggressive all-wheel-drive system and rear axle. The CLA 45 also adds a distinctive AMG grille and standard 19-inch wheels, as well as different lower body trim. And an active exhaust system changes the sound based on the drive mode selected. \n\nAn optional AMG Aerodynamic Package includes exterior revisions to the lower front trim and adds a rear spoiler, while a Night Package makes the exterior trim a gloss black. The AMG Ride Control system allows the driver to switch between three settings for either a better ride or firmer handling. Performance race seats and Nappa leather upholstery or Dinamica synthetic fabric are among the interior options. Prices for the CLA 45 are not yet available.\n\n### Value\n\nAmong compact luxury vehicles, the CLA is a slightly more expensive choice and slightly less well-equipped than some. But it offers more standard performance without a fuel economy penalty and throws in some striking looks inside and out. It has somewhat more practicality than a two-door like the [BMW 230i](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-2+series) Coupe but isn’t as accommodating for rear passengers as a traditional sedan like an [Audi A3](https://www.autolist.com/audi-a3). And Mercedes’ own [A-Class](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-a+class) sedan may take a hit in performance, but offers basically the same features as the CLA for thousands less. However, both feature complicated controls and make optional some advanced safety and technology features that competitors make standard.\n\nUltimately, it comes down to whether the CLA’s smooth lines are worth the sacrifice over a more traditional sedan. That may be worth the added initial outlay.\n\n### More Photos\n\nSee more [2020 Mercedes CLA Photos](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-cla+class-2020/2020-mercedes-cla-photos).\n",

      "body": "The first generation of Ford F-Series pickup trucks was introduced in 1948. Descending from the very first Ford Model TT Pickup, and later, the Model 50 Pickup, it was not until the second generation that Ford’s current naming system was set in place. The F-100, F-250, and F-350 pickup trucks had been built since 1953, but the actual F-150, which eventually replaced the smaller F-100, did not make its debut until 1975 and was sold alongside the F-100 until 1983 when that model was discontinued.  \n\n### 2015 - Present Ford F-150 (8th Generation)\n\n[![ford-f150-8th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7qaPEHkHi5c7kDtsvqXcV/457ea7ca5076a1d7f56c3d37fbddee3a/ford-f150-8th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150#year_min=2015&year_max)\n\nThe most recent version of the F-150 is larger than before and features the choice of a 2.7-liter and 3.5-liter Ecoboost turbocharged V6s, or a 5.0-liter V8 engine and further updated styling, mimicking that of the larger F-250 and F-350 trucks. The regular, crew and super cabs are available, and luxury touches like LED headlights, advanced safety features, automatic start-stop, and a 10-speed automatic transmission keep it at the forefront of vehicle technology.  \n\nThe Raptor was revised in 2017 and comes standard with a more powerful 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 while all F-150s feature a steel frame with an aluminum body.  \n\n[View 8th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150#year_min=2015&year_max)\n\n### 2009 - 2014 Ford F-150 (7th Generation)\n\n[![ford-f150-7th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2LGZQkyR72fuyyWX9PUuU3/355795bb6e94f31fa4db0dae664d2a53/ford-f150-7th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150#year_min=2009&year_max=2014)\n\n2009 saw another complete redesign of the F-150, including a fully boxed frame, an updated body shape, and luxury features that were previously reserved for posh cars and luxury SUVs. All-new engine options, including the 3.5-liter Ecoboost and 3.7-liter V6s, as well as the 5.0 and 6.2-liter V8s,  became available as well as the iconic Ford SVT Raptor in 2010.  \n\nContinued refinement of the F-150 continued with small changes throughout the 7th generation with minor updates, including HID headlights, heated seats, and other luxury touches that continue to make the F-150 a viable family vehicle rather than a strict work truck.  \n\n[View 7th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150#year_min=2009&year_max=2014)\n\n### 2004 - 2008 Ford F-150 (6th Generation) \n\n[![ford-f150-6th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/74jm9HMn0JO0cyhUMUOncw/53bed67997d257951f486985b1113040/ford-f150-6th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150#year_min=2004&year_max=2008)\n\nThe 2004 model year brought another exterior redesign that featured more squared design cues in the headlights, taillights, and other design elements. The regular cab and super crew both featured four doors while interior comfort reached new levels, making the F-150 even larger and more family-friendly than its predecessors. The V6 engine remained the base engine with a five-speed manual remaining standard while the 5.4-liter V8 remained optional, only available in an automatic transmission.  \n\nWith the choice of a 6.5 or 8-foot bed, a five-star safety rating, and the redesign that came with the 6th generation truck, the F-150 won multiple awards. It cemented itself further as not only a work truck but a family vehicle as well.\n\n[View 6th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150#year_min=2004&year_max=2008)\n\n### 1996 - 2003 Ford F-150 (5th Generation)\n\n[![ford-f150-5th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7dLZYN5Gtr9Exy3FaAniFo/46bf4d8d0cecd8316c77fe0a72c74594/ford-f150-5th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150#year_min=1996&year_max=2003)\n\n1996 saw a complete makeover of the F-150 design with both regular and super cab layouts. It was more rounded and more oriented to being a passenger vehicle as well as a hauler. The inline six-cylinder was replaced with a 4.2-liter V6, and the V8 options changed to 4.6 and 5.4-liter units, producing well over 200 horsepower. A five-speed manual transmission remained standard.  \n\nThe SVT Lightning performance F-150 was re-introduced for 1999 as a performance version of the truck, and the Super Cab introduced a rear-hinged suicide door layout to allow for better overall practicality. Additionally, the 5.4-liter V8 got a power upgrade to 250 horsepower. The Super Crew Cab, a true four-door cab layout, and the top-of-the-line King Ranch trim were both introduced.  \n\n[View 5th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150#year_min=1996&year_max=2003)\n\n### 1992 - 1996 Ford F-150 (4th Generation)\n\n[![ford-f150-4th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3PwGx1prdYSXNRFY54fFd7/42891e774e9b3b871776d00cea7040c6/ford-f150-4th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150#year_min=1992&year_max=1996)\n\nThe 1992 F-150 was introduced with more aerodynamic styling and a choice of a base inline six-cylinder or the same V8 engine options as before: A 5.0-liter or 5.8-liter. These were mated to a three-speed automatic, four-speed manual, four-speed automatic, or five-speed manual transmission.   \n\nThe Nite package, which offered black paint and came standard with the 5.8 liter V8, was available through the 1991 model year, but the SVT Lightning came in and took its place in 1993. It was mainly a sport version of the F-150 with the upgraded performance from the 5.8-liter powertrain. Driver airbags came standard in 1994, and 1995 marked the last year of the inline six-cylinder engine.  \n\n[View 4th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150#year_min=1992&year_max=1996)\n\n### 1987 - 1991 Ford F-150 (3rd Generation)\n\n[![ford-f150-3rd-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/177lXgdIcYiS53BbPKtiOO/8d47e7686f9d287a41cf3f9c87746df5/ford-f150-3rd-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150#year_min=1987&year_max=1991)\n\n1987 saw a slightly more rounded design than the previous generation F-150 while engine options remained the same with additional horsepower gains. The four-speed manual transmission became standard, and the four-speed automatic was optional. Further improvements in ride dynamics made the F-150 more livable as a daily driver and even as a family vehicle.  \n\nRegular and super cab models were still standard, and a five-speed manual transmission was made standard for the 1988 model year with a three or four-speed automatic as options.  \n\n[View 3rd Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150#year_min=1987&year_max=1991)\n\n### 1980 - 1986 Ford F-150 (2nd Generation)\n\n[![ford-f150-2nd-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3bAgHqNKLxjbGakOanqt3S/88f4fafd156b933706968c71cfb13a09/ford-f150-2nd-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150#year_min=1980&year_max=1986)\n\nThe 2nd generation Ford F-150, the seventh of the F-Series pickup, was introduced for 1980 with the same wheelbase and cargo capacity, yet with less weight. Improved styling, including an egg-crate grille, a more refined ride, and regular and super cab options were made available to the consumer.  \n\nThe inline six-cylinder engine was still standard, and two V8 engine options – a 5.0 liter and 5.8 liter – were available, both with over 130 horsepower and over 230 lb-ft of torque. A four-speed manual transmission and four-speed automatic transmission were introduced for 1981. Additionally, fuel injection was launched in 1985 to the inline-six-cylinder and base V8 powerplants.  \n\n[View 2nd Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150#year_min=1980&year_max=1986)\n\n### 1975 - 1979 Ford F-150 (1st Generation)\n\n[![ford-f150-1st-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1onDgkN7ki7BgLYlIRjhLp/de2a8582c06e413a2e1056482df6dda1/ford-f150-1st-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150#year_min=1975&year_max=1979)\n\nThe F-150 was introduced in 1975, right in the middle of the sixth generation of Ford F-Series trucks. It was larger than the F-100 but smaller than the F-250 and was offered in both regular and super cab options. The base engine was an inline six-cylinder producing just 113 horsepower. Two V8 engine options provided 145 and 160 horsepower, respectively. Its signature round headlights and large rectangular grille continue to be very recognizable today.  \n\nAn additional V8 engine option in 1976 and subsequent other V8 offerings with much-needed horsepower boosts in 1977 were welcomed by the public. Rectangular headlights replaced circular ones in 1978, but otherwise, significant styling changes were minimal. A three-speed manual transmission came standard with an optional automatic transmission.\n\n[View 1st Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150#year_min=1975&year_max=1979)",

When you go to sell a vehicle, you can have the title signed around by the buyer and seller, but that is not a guarantee that the buyer will then go to the Department of Motor Vehicles and get the title officially transferred and registered in their name. \n\nAs a seller, that's one reason it's essential to report the car as sold with the DMV and make sure that you have filed any release of liability forms as well as having them in your records. \n\n### What is Title Jumping?\n\nThe process of buying a vehicle and never transferring the title in your name, but then selling the vehicle again is called title jumping. It describes the action of the title \"jumping\" over one owner and on to the next. The new owner gets the title, but the previous owner avoided sales taxes and registration fees by never registering the car in their name. The origin of this process was with shady car dealers who wanted to avoid paying taxes. However, plenty of regular car buyers now do it to avoid paying taxes. It's important to know that title jumping is illegal in every state. It doesn't matter if you buy a vehicle and then immediately sell it, you still have to transfer ownership into your name first.\n\n### What Happens to Title Jumpers?\n\nThe majority of states require a vehicle title to be transferred within a specified period after buying the vehicle. If you don't do this, you're subject to fines and penalties. Not only that, but you still have to transfer the title. At no point is that not an option. If you don't move the title and then try to sell the vehicle, you are committing an illegal act. You could be fined and even do jail time.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### What Happens if You Buy a Title Jumped Vehicle?\n\nAs a buyer, it's essential to ensure that the current owner selling your prospective car is also the person on the title. There are some exceptions. If the person signing over the title to you has power of attorney over the person on the title. However, they need to present proof of it, and you will need proof of it to transfer the title. Otherwise, you could have difficulties getting the title in your name, not to mention having to get back to the last person's name on the title. Sometimes people who are title jumping will tell you that they have lost the title or something similar. Don't buy a vehicle until a duplicate title arrives with the correct names on it.\n\n### Recourse as a Title Jumping Victim\n\nIf you end up buying a vehicle with no certificate of title, or a title that doesn't have the seller's name, then you have a few options. If you bought the car from a dealership, then you can file a claim of fraud against the business, or you can have them take the car back. \n\nIf you bought from a private party, contact the seller and try to get them to transfer the original title into their name. Once they get it, sign the title over to you. \n\nIf you bought a car where the title was lost, then you'll likely have to seek help at the DMV. You may have to get a bonded title, or you may have to contact the last known owner of the car to ensure their release of interest.\n\n### Bonded Titles\n\nTo deal with title jumping or a missing title, you may have to get a bonded title. That is a marked title. It looks like a regular title except for the bonded brand. You can get the brand removed in three to five years if there are no issues, and then you can apply for a clean title. To get a bonded title, you will be required by the DMV to buy a Lost Title Bond.\n\n### Getting a Bonded Title\n\nStart by checking with the DMV to see if you're eligible. Only the DMV can tell you for sure if you're eligible. Explain your situation and then ask if you're eligible. \n\n__The following are four common situations where you might need one:__\n\n- You didn't receive a title when you bought a vehicle\n\n- You only got a bill of sale when you bought a vehicle\n\n- You received an improperly assigned title when you bought a vehicle\n\n- You lost your title after receiving it\n\n### Buy a Lost Title Bond\n\nTo get a bonded title for a vehicle that doesn't have a title, you have to buy a surety bond. The average cost is usually around $100. Once you receive the bond by mail, you can turn it into the DMV to finish the application for a bonded title. The bond is there to confirm that you are the real owner of the vehicle. As long as you are the rightful owner, you shouldn't have to be concerned about anyone appearing and making a claim against your bond.\n\n### States That Don't Allow Bonded Titles\n\nNot all states allow you to get bonded titles. Those are Delaware, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Virginia. \n\nIndiana and Ohio do not accept bonded titles, but they do take court-ordered titles.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### How to Ensure Title Transfer as a Seller\n\nUnfortunately, there's only so much you can do as the seller to ensure that the buyer transfers the title into their name. They are subject to penalties if they don't in a certain amount of time, but those typically aren't enforced until the buyer does the transfer. \n\nHowever, you can protect your liability. The primary way to do this is to get on the DMV's site and report the sale immediately. Make copies of the bill of sale, odometer disclosure and the signed-around title. You can then file these with the DMV through the mail or in person. Make sure to take all vehicle registration papers out of the vehicle and call your insurance company to cancel insurance as well.\n\n### When You Don't Ensure Vehicle Transfer\n\nIf you don't follow up and trust that the buyer will do their job, you could end up getting traffic or parking tickets in the mail. You might even get an impound or towing notice if the new owner ends up in that situation. In all of these situations, having proof is your best friend. Most states will back up sellers who have evidence that they sold the vehicle. If you're a buyer, it's essential to be a good customer and obey the law on your end to give the seller peace of mind. Even when selling to a family member, it's a good idea to cover all your bases.\n\n### Title Transfer by State\n\nDifferent states have different rules on transferring a title. Most have a specific period that you have to transfer the vehicle's title before being penalized. This period is usually 30 days from the date of sale, but can be as long as 60 or as short as 15. Some states require an odometer reading, while others don't. \n\nStates like Washington also require the seller to notify the DOL of the sale date, including the name and address of the buyer as well as a driver's license if available, and a description of the vehicle including the vehicle identification number. The original seller is required to file this notice within five business days of the sale. Washington also requires the new owner to apply for a new title within 15 days versus the usual 30. Many states also require you to remove license plates before letting the buyer leave with the vehicle.",

The coupe variant was dropped, leaving the Accord available only as a four-door sedan. Also, the V6 option was eliminated, replaced by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with 252 horsepower. Most trims have a 1.5-liter turbocharged four with 182 or 190 horsepower, depending on trim. \n\nUnlike most of its peers, a manual transmission remained available on both engine variants. A gas-electric hybrid model returned, powered by a four-cylinder engine and producing 212 horsepower. \n\nExternally, the Accord adopted a lower, sleeker profile that made it appear more sporty than the previous model. \n\n[View 10th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=2018&year_max)\n\n### 2013 - 2017 Honda Accord (9th Generation)\n\n[![honda-accord-9th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3k4X5bbOod95Vn0Kk32hXq/5ee8fdfef1801f2304e7a4abb69842fc/honda-accord-9th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=2013&year_max=2017)\n\nHonda substantially revised the Accord for 2013 and reduced its external size while maintaining most of its interior space. Engines got more powerful and efficient, with the four-cylinder model adopting a continuously variable transmission to boost efficiency. \n\nThe V6 gained a six-speed automatic, while the top-level coupe could also be equipped with a six-speed manual. \n\nSignificant new features included standard backup cameras, forward-collision-warning, lane departure warning, and the LaneWatch camera system. Honda also improved the crash protection of the Accord significantly over the previous model but managed to address concerns that the old one was too big and boring to drive. \n\nA hybrid returned as an option, this time using a four-cylinder engine. Also -- for the first time -- Honda offered a plug-in hybrid Accord. Only available in 2014 in certain states, the PHEV model was a flop. Instead, the hybrid returned in 2016 with a more efficient powertrain.\n\n[View 9th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=2013&year_max=2017)\n\n### 2008 - 2012 Honda Accord (8th Generation)\n\n[![honda-accord-8th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/P5Mn9SHhNXVGYK2OVQHPV/ba194f3318fd0f1516f9cb6f8c87516d/honda-accord-8th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=2008&year_max=2012)\n\nThe Accord was greatly enlarged for 2008, with the sedan qualifying as a Large Car by the EPA. The length increased by as much as four inches and width by three inches. \n\nThe base model was now the LX, and it used a 177-horsepower four-cylinder engine, while the EX and higher trims got a 190-horsepower version of the four-cylinder. \n\nV6 models produced between 268 and 271 horsepower, all mated to an automatic, except for the EX-L Coupe that could be had with a six-speed manual. \n\nNew features that debuted with this model included a rearview camera with a navigation system and a USB connection.\n\n[View 8th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=2008&year_max=2012)\n\n### 2003 - 2007 Honda Accord (7th Generation)\n\n[![honda-accord-7th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7p3wscmMERhmIE2Tqt36v1/2ed3936250e737480723c26c28eb3ccb/honda-accord-7th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=2003&year_max=2007)\n\nFor its seventh generation, Honda increased the size of the Accord coupes and sedans, as well as gave it a more upscale appearance and new technology. \n\nWhile the four-cylinder engine gained a few horsepower, bumping it up to 160, the V6 gained 40 horsepower to produce 240 – a class-leading number at the time. \n\nFor the first time, satellite navigation, electronic stability control, and side curtain airbags could be had on an Accord. LED taillights were even introduced during this generation’s run, previously something found only on luxury cars. \n\nIn 2005, an Accord Hybrid was offered for the first time. It used the V6 mated to an electric motor, providing good performance but not much more efficiency than a regular V6.\n\n[View 7th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=2003&year_max=2007)\n\n### 1998 - 2002 Honda Accord (6th Generation)\n\n[![honda-accord-6th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7vxzCjBCCoGi1ChZItuHpR/c738fbf5494510cdcfa6d22727a749b2/honda-accord-6th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=1998&year_max=2002)\n\nHonda revised the Accord again for 1998, making it larger and more powerful. The wagon was discontinued, but the coupe adopted more distinctive styling over the more generic-looking sedan.\n\nAll models grew larger, and the Accord was firmly considered a midsize car by the EPA, alongside other popular models like the Ford Taurus and Toyota Camry. \n\nThe four-cylinder engine grew to 2.3-liters but made the same power, while the new 3.0-liter V6 offered 200 horsepower, among the highest output of any midsize sedan. \n\nFour-cylinder models still offered a five-speed manual, but most models received a four-speed automatic.\n\nOn the safety front, side airbags became available on specific models.\n\nThe Accord, briefly, was the best-selling car in the U.S again, in 2001.\n\n[View 6th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=1998&year_max=2002)\n\n### 1994 - 1997 Honda Accord (5th Generation)\n\n[![honda-accord-5th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4fjfTM7M7Z42dgOLAbVp9R/ada49c16175bc68d8832bc8d6e4581f9/honda-accord-5th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=1994&year_max=1997)\n\nIn its fifth generation, the Accord grew even more refined. The angular design was replaced by a more curved shape that was reminiscent of the Prelude sports coupe of the time. \n\nAs before, coupe, sedan, and wagon models were offered. Dual airbags were now standard, as was a wider availability of anti-lock brakes and other safety features. \n\nA 2.2-liter four-cylinder with between 130 and 145 horsepower was offered. But for 1995, the Accord sedan was for the first time made available with a 2.7-liter V6 engine with 170 horsepower. \n\nStill one of the most popular vehicles sold in the U.S., the Accord changed very little in this generation.\n\n[View 5th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=1994&year_max=1997)\n\n### 1990 - 1993 Honda Accord (4th Generation)\n\n[![honda-accord-4th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6MhOGf5EPS2v4EZjvpqsJ9/0b3a9c148a1ce71be89a94e3eed59cac/honda-accord-4th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=1990&year_max=1993)\n\nHonda updated the Accord for the 1990s with more refinement and room, a winning trend since the previous model eventually marched to be the best-selling car in the U.S. \n\nThe coupe and sedan grew again by another six inches in length and were also noticeably wider. The hatchback was dropped, but a five-door wagon soon took its place to compete with the likes of the Ford Taurus and Toyota Camry. \n\nAll Accords were now fuel-injected, powered by a 2.2-liter four-cylinder with up to 130 horsepower on the new EX model. \n\nFeatures such as leather upholstery and a sunroof were now part of the options list, as well as some models that received a high-end Bose audio system and anti-lock brakes. \n\nIn 1992, the Accord received a driver’s side airbag.\n\n[View 4th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=1990&year_max=1993)\n\n### 1986 - 1989 Honda Accord (3rd Generation)\n\n[![honda-accord-3rd-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4Q9fvrT1m8wYpvFeV3D3g8/29cfb623ba76fb0749defb4476c4f1f3/honda-accord-3rd-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=1986&year_max=1989)\n\nThe Accord grew substantially with the third generation, moving firmly out of its economy car roots and competing with mainstream sedans. \n\nAs well as a hatchback, a two-door coupe was added for 1988. \n\nBut the sedan remained the most popular version, and it grew roughly six inches longer than the previous model. It also boasted more sophisticated styling, complete with sports car-like pop-up headlights. The body was also made more aerodynamic to improve styling and interior noise, while interior space was usefully expanded. \n\nA redesigned suspension made the Accord better to drive at high speeds, which gave it a reputation for being fun to drive among enthusiasts. \n\nA new 2.0-liter engine produced 98 horsepower with a carburetor or 110 with fuel injection.  \n\n[View 3rd Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=1986&year_max=1989)\n\n### 1982 - 1985 Honda Accord (2nd Generation)\n\n[![honda-accord-2nd-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1QistRaygdeYUdKn4s2u6v/da959966f8c64ec121d9243c47cbc5c4/honda-accord-2nd-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=1982&year_max=1985)\n\nHonda continued with its popular format with the next Accord. Buyers got more power and more room, as well as more technology. \n\nModels offered items like a cassette player, velour upholstery, and power windows and locks. \n\nThe 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine now produced as much as 86 horsepower and could be had with a four-speed automatic. In 1985, the limited production SE-i model was among the first mainstream cars to come equipped with electronically controlled fuel injection, allowing the engine to make 110 horsepower. \n\nThis generation Accord is significant because it was the first to be built in the U.S.; Honda established an assembly plant in Ohio in 1982, helping its factory in Japan supply Accords for the American market. Since then, Honda has become one of the largest auto producers in the U.S.\n\n[View 2nd Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=1982&year_max=1985)\n\n### 1977 - 1981 Honda Accord (1st Generation)\n\n[![honda-accord-1st-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6sX6FvA6deXiHrVIkcvDmD/19e9ba6b248013cfe51ddd15b7a74335/honda-accord-1st-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=1977&year_max=1981)\n\nOn the heels of the success of the Civic, Honda sought to add another model to its U.S. lineup. Introduced for 1977, the Accord offered more room, power, and equipment than the economy-minded Civic. \n\nWhile the first Accord hatchback (a sedan was added for 1978) was only about the size of a modern VW Golf, it offered equipment more commonly found on luxury cars. These included full cloth seats, AM/FM radio, a digital clock, air conditioning, and power steering. Even a five-speed manual was standard, although a two- or three-speed automatic was available. \n\nA Special Edition model also received power windows and leather upholstery. Initially, the power came from a 1.6-liter four-cylinder that produced 68 horsepower, using emissions-cutting technology from the Civic. \n\nBut the Accord found favor with buyers who wanted excellent fuel efficiency and a vehicle that offered greater luxury than the typical Japanese economy car. \n\nHonda would follow the first Accord up with another hit in the second-generation model.\n\n[View 1st Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#year_min=1977&year_max=1981)",

This Honda’s quick selling time also beat the national average for all minivans in its segment, which is also 33 days.\n\nNipping on the Odyssey’s heels at a median of 26 days-on-market was the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid, the Toyota Yaris iA, and Nissan Sentra.\n\n\nThe sole outlier in this top-ten list was the Mercedes-Benz GLS, by virtue of both not being Japanese and because it’s the only being a large, luxury SUV on this list. It too took a median of 26 days to sell, according to Autolist’s data.\n\n![AS 0250-source (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3GUKS3Oj6HL3TkA9vT4yL3/4478c036509ab25dd28d6a7ab69f879d/_AS_0250-source__1_.jpg)\n\nThe rest of the top-ten fastest sellers all took a median of 27 days to sell nationally: Honda Civic, Honda Fit, Toyota RAV4 (gas version), Toyota Corolla, and Honda Fit.\n\nThe popularity of small cars in 2019 is a trend many forecasters are expecting to continue in 2020. These cars appeal to those who are downsizing, buyers on a tighter budget, those with tighter credit, younger buyers, first-time car shoppers, or empty-nesters.\n\nThe declining volumes of these small cars entering the used market have not been met with an equal decline in demand, keeping prices healthy for smaller cars. Small and midsize cars saw the highest price appreciation on the used market in 2019, according to J.D. Power. \n\nAdditionally, because they appeal to a wide customer base, the popularity of these sedans and hatchbacks is better prepared to weather the light truck storm. \n\n![FordEcoSport 01 HR (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5GelpxlEm3h9qo1iVOwgxj/1b4fe0a7055f81643d710ad8aa50a24a/FordEcoSport_01_HR__1_.jpg)\n\n\"The EcoSport is the rare small crossover that struggled to sell in 2019,\" Disher said. \"It's simply outclassed in most respects by almost every one of its subcompact rivals and that shows up in our sales data.\" \n\nAutolist’s slow-selling list was also dominated by five large American sedans that historically have been favored by older buyers: Lincoln MKS, Buick LaCrosse, Ford Taurus, Lincoln Continental, and Cadillac CT6. \n\n“Our data shows that while small and or fuel-efficient cars and crossovers remain popular, large, American luxury and near-luxury sedans are just the opposite,” Disher said. “Buyers who have the budgets for these models -- even on the used market -- are rapidly switching to crossovers and SUVs.”\n\nThe remaining four vehicles on this list were the Land Rover Discovery, the Buick Regal Sportback, the Land Rover Range Rover Velar, and the Porsche Panamera. \n\n![Slowest-selling chart (2)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3twai6q2aywjqlsWlxWTJ0/56a3a58a08a71721de1f0195ee9437dc/Slowest-selling_chart__2_.jpg)\n\nWhile landing on the slow-selling list may seem like a knock against a particular model, it may also create a chance for more aggressive bargaining by shoppers who still prefer one of these vehicles. \n\n“This relative unpopularity could actually be a benefit for fans of these vehicles since it means it’s a buyer’s market, and they’re in the driver’s seat when it comes to negotiating,” said Disher. \n\nTo gather the data in this study, Autolist.com looked at more than 4 million used vehicles that left the Autolist marketplace from April to September 2019 (six months). Only vehicles from the 2015 to 2018 model years were included due to the high concentration of the used market found in that timeframe. Vehicles with fewer than 100 miles on them were excluded from the analysis, as well as low-volume specialty models.\n",

Built on a new global platform, this Civic features a low and wide profile with a sloping roof and a slightly more spacious interior and trunk. The base LX trim is powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 158 horsepower, with either a six-speed manual or continuously variable transmission. \n\nAll models now include automatic climate control and a rear-view camera. Higher up, the EX-T, EX-L, and Touring trim levels carry a 178-horsepower, 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder. The top-of-the-line Touring comes with a leather interior, a 10-speaker sound system, and a Honda Sensing package — which includes lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, and forward collision alert—as standard features.  \n\nA new Sport trim for the sedan and coupe variants is now available with a six-speed manual transmission and optional continuously variable transmission, 18-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, and center exhaust. Features such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also available on most models. Also, the Type-R hot hatchback came to the U.S. for the first time, offering 306 horsepower from a 2.0-liter turbo four.\n\n[View 10th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=2016&year_max)\n\n### 2012 – 2015 Honda Civic (9th Generation)\n\n[![honda-civic-9th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4jkxaHXGK2iPuyeBNuRqQP/89c087a6757b8148acb80b2d3cf97ff0/honda-civic-9th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=2012&year_max=2015)\n\nThe ninth-generation Civic was unveiled at the 2011 North American International Auto Show in both coupe and sedan configurations. This generation’s DX, LX, EX, and EX-L trim levels retained the 140-horsepower, 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine of the previous generation, while the Si model got a larger 2.4-liter engine that produced 201 horsepower. All models came with electronic stability control, anti-lock brakes, and a new multi-link rear suspension that improved the ride quality and handling on rough roads. Buyers could choose between manual and automatic transmissions, and between hybrid and natural-gas versions. The 2012 redesign introduced Honda’s Eco Assist technology, which monitored the driver’s driving style and displays its impact on fuel efficiency.\n\n[View 9th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=2012&year_max=2015)\n\n### 2006 – 2011 Honda Civic (8th Generation)\n\n[![honda-civic-8th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/166x9rNTdSCF6VbjdFMz3M/03d9446bfeee927a0053763156a6d322/honda-civic-8th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=2006&year_max=2011)\n\nThe 2006 redesign introduced a raked windshield that gave the coupe and sedan a sporty, futuristic look. Both the coupe and sedan were available in a variety of trim levels (DX, DX-G, LX, EX, and EX-L). The Hybrid model only came as a sedan, and the Si was offered as a coupe and sedan for the first time. Inside, the analog instrument panel of the previous generation was replaced with a two-tier digital panel. Under the hood, the DX, LX, and EX models shared a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine that produced 140 horsepower. All models except the hybrid had five-speed transmissions. The Civic Hybrid featured a 1.3-liter 4-cylinder engine and an electric motor that produced a combined maximum of 110 horsepower—23 percent more power than the previous generation’s hybrid.\n\n[View 8th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=2006&year_max=2011)\n\n### 2001 – 2005 Honda Civic (7th Generation)\n\n[![honda-civic-7th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/68neDzdWozVbJOlLnc0YJv/63a81200d5cff0317b2dac547b1e2a1f/honda-civic-7th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=2001&year_max=2005)\n\nThe seventh-generation Civic debuted with sedan and coupe body styles and four trim levels: DX, LX, EX, and HX. The Si model, which was offered as a three-door hatchback, rejoined the lineup for 2002. Honda also introduced the Civic Hybrid as a sedan powered by a 1.3-liter engine. The DX and LX models got a horsepower bump—from 106 hp to 115 hp—while the EX model maintained the previous generation’s 127 horsepower. A five-speed manual transmission came standard, but a four-speed automatic was optional. A CVT transmission was available on the HX to maximize fuel economy. Standard safety features included front airbags and an engine-immobilizing theft-deterrent system.\n\n[View 7th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=2001&year_max=2005)\n\n### 1996 – 2000 Honda Civic (6th Generation)\n\n[![honda-civic-6th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/63FYwHNanJKgRaZ4Pq52xb/cf095996ffb112b0dacfc59a5ef4dce9/honda-civic-6th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=1996&year_max=2000)\n\nThe sixth-generation Civic was available in sedan, coupe, and hatchback configurations. All body styles shared a 103.4-inch wheelbase that offered more interior space. Out of the standard 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, the CX, DX, and LX trim levels got 106 horsepower, the HX coupe got 115 horsepower, and the top-tier EX sedan got 127 horsepower. The EX model boasted keyless entry, cruise control, a power sunroof, and full-wheel covers. Fuel economy still defined the Civic, with the HX model being the mileage leader. With a five-speed transmission, the HX could do 39 mpg and 45 mpg in city and highway driving, respectively. On other trims, buyers could choose between a five-speed manual and a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\n[View 6th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=1996&year_max=2000)\n\n### ### 1992 – 1995 Honda Civic (5th Generation)\n\n[![honda-civic-5th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1idveWy1I9nVFsw801FDv3/c25625fad57e0e320edad6723edab0fd/honda-civic-5th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=1992&year_max=1995)\n\nThe 1992 redesign saw the Civic drop its boxy look and take on a more aerodynamic design. Both the sedan and hatchback were built on a longer wheelbase, which made the new Civic larger than most of its predecessors. Honda dropped the wagon but added a two-door coupe model in 1993. Six trim levels were available, depending on body style: CX, DX, VX, LX, Si, and EX. The base CX trim married a 70-horsepower, 1.5-liter 4-cylinder gas engine with a five-speed manual transmission. The Si and EX models had 1.6-liter gas engines that churned out 125 horsepower.\n\n[View 5th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=1992&year_max=1995)\n\n### 1988 – 1991 Honda Civic (4th Generation)\n\n[![honda-civic-4th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7tXqbz9TO4Bsw5UgDfVQkL/7810d78d3b162e3eca7261bf6085f5dc/honda-civic-4th-generation.jpg)](hhttps://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=1988&year_max=1991)\n\nThe Civic was completely redesigned for the fourth generation. Its wheelbase was increased by 2 to 4 inches to 98.4 inches, and the body got a lower hood line and more glass. Honda kept the distinctive boxy shape of the previous generations. In the U.S., the Civic was available as a sedan, hatchback, and wagon in Standard, DX, LX, and EX and Si trim levels. The base Standard model was powered by a 75-horsepower 1.5-liter engine that was matched with a four-speed manual transmission. An automatic four-speed transmission was also available. The sporty Civic Si, which was only available as a hatchback, churned out 108 horsepower. Standard features on the Si trim included a large exhaust, air conditioning, and fog lights.\n\n[View 4th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=1988&year_max=1991)\n\n### 1984 – 1987 Honda Civic (3rd Generation)\n\n[![honda-civic-3rd-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/oI3MvmkbgV14Flha5sRb7/8a92ef5df700d3d065bbf3191f93fd65/honda-civic-3rd-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=1984&year_max=1987)\n\nThe third-generation Civic was available as a three-door hatchback, four-door sedan, five-door station wagon, and a sporty coupe. All models were built on a larger platform that increased the previous generation’s wheelbase by 2 to 5 inches to 93.7 inches. The base hatchback CRX model ran on a 1.3-liter 8-valve engine that produced 60 horsepower. Other trim levels got a new 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine.\n\n[View 3rd Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=1984&year_max=1987)\n\n### ### 1980 – 1983 Honda Civic (2nd Generation)\n\n[![honda-civic-2nd-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4lgWJb9phAyNAZWTFZYEGt/e7052ff5af724656e93cd78430d20151/honda-civic-2nd-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=1980&year_max=1983)\n\nSecond-generation Civics had more angular shapes and were larger than the models of the previous generation. The wheelbase grew from 86.6 to 88.6 inches for the hatchback and from 89.9 to 91.3 inches for the wagon. The two-door sedan of the previous generation was dropped from this generation’s lineup. Buyers could choose between two engine options: a base 1.3-liter engine that produced 55 horsepower and a more powerful 1.5-liter engine with 67 horsepower. The four-speed manual transmission of the previous generation came as standard equipment on the base model. The mid-range DX version featured a five-speed manual transmission, partial cloth seats, and rear window defroster. To this package, the top-of-the-line Civic 1500 GL added radial tires, a tachometer, and body side moldings.\n\n[View 2nd Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=1980&year_max=1983)\n\n### 1973 – 1979 Honda Civic (1st Generation)\n\n[![honda-civic-1st-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4VOXJvBbdHKVfs1tmAZshW/33a2088c36f7a4f07755e31a5f130ca5/honda-civic-1st-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=1973&year_max=1979)\n\nThe first-generation Honda Civic went on sale for 1973. It was available as a two-door sedan, three-door hatchback and five-door station wagon. Standard features included a dashboard with wood-grain accents, reclining bucket seats, and 12-inch wheels. The hatchback boasted a fold-down rear seat, cloth upholstery, and an AM radio. These first models were fitted with a 1.2-liter four-cylinder engine that produced about 50 horsepower. Subsequent generational modifications increased power to 52 horsepower. Four-speed manual transmission was standard across the line. Optional features included air conditioning, radial tires, and a two-speed semi-automatic transmission.\n\n[View 1st Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=1973&year_max=1979)",

It migrated to a modern platform shared with many new Toyota passenger cars. The length decreased slightly, but the width was increased. \n\nThe 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine now produced 206 horsepower, while the hybrid also increased in power to 219. The CVT now mimicked a conventional automatic transmission with eight speeds to allow for better driver control. \n\nAll-wheel-drive models gained a controller for drivers to select a road surface so it would be better programmed to keep the vehicle moving. The Adventure model returned, as well. \n\nNew technology features included Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa compatibility, as well as a wireless smartphone charger. \n\nStandard safety features included adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warning with automatic braking, and lane departure warning. \n\nWith all of the upgrades, the RAV4 continues to be one of the best-selling vehicles in the U.S. every year.\n\n[View 5th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-rav4#year_min=2019&year_max)\n\n### 2014 - 2018 Toyota RAV4 (4th Generation)\n\n[![toyota-rav4-4th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3XuL4ybmvx19Lb07NUupbk/e23b7ff6a3137de1f94c30fd35a646a9/toyota-rav4-4th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-rav4#year_min=2014&year_max=2018)\n\nThe RAV4 was made slightly more conventional for this generation over the previous gen. \n\nThe V6 and third-row seats were gone, even though the vehicle was somewhat longer than before. A four-cylinder and continuously variable transmission combo were made standard, however, increasing fuel efficiency. The spare tire was also mounted under the cargo floor, and a liftgate was added, a formula other compact SUVs had been using for years. \n\nToyota gave the RAV4 a facelift in 2015 for the 2016 model year. It streamlined the exterior styling, added more sound deadening inside for greater refinement, and added several other features. \n\nFor more efficiency, a hybrid variant also joined the RAV4 lineup for the first time in 2016. The standard 2.5-liter four-cylinder was paired with an electric motor, and another one to power the rear wheels if the all-wheel-drive option was selected. \n\nFinally, a rugged-looking Adventure model was added for 2017, even if it wasn’t mechanically different from the standard models. \n\n[View 4th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-rav4#year_min=2014&year_max=2018)\n\n### 2007 - 2013 Toyota RAV4 (3rd Generation)\n\n[![toyota-rav4-3rd-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/NbKevUKOlUCGB94VlCKhs/92d67efeadceda6022ea7ac5c23914ea/toyota-rav4-3rd-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-rav4#year_min=2007&year_max=2013)\n\nGiving customers more of what they wanted, Toyota significantly grew the RAV4 for 2007. \n\nWhile a four-cylinder with slightly more power was still standard, a V6 was available for the first time, producing 268 horsepower – far more than anything else in the class. The vehicle itself grew 15 inches longer and even offered a third-row seat in some versions. Although its small size made it only usable for children, it folded into the cargo floor when not in use. \n\nAs before, front-wheel-drive was standard, with available all-wheel-drive. All models now received an automatic transmission. \n\nThis generation also gained features such as side curtain airbags, available backup camera and navigation system, keyless entry, and push-button start. A Sport model also came with run-flat tires.\n\nThis generation also spawned an electric-only variant in 2012. Through an agreement with Tesla, the RAV4 EV used a 37kWh battery pack with a range of around 100 miles. Select customers in California could lease it for $599 per month for three years. About 2,500 were produced. A spare tire and third-row seat were not available on the EV.\n\n[View 3rd Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-rav4#year_min=2007&year_max=2013)\n\n### 2002 - 2006 Toyota RAV4 (2nd Generation)\n\n[![toyota-rav4-2nd-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/36ioyi16SYbllBHfczx97E/31c348ad8bd86205f72a17cce679e170/toyota-rav4-2nd-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-rav4#year_min=2002&year_max=2006)\n\nCapitalizing on the unexpected success of the RAV4, Toyota made the second generation bigger, which was released for 2002. Now only available as a five-door, the model gained about three inches in length, but also an inch and a half in width for better passenger space and cargo room. \n\nIt still used the swing door with the spare tire mounted on the outside. \n\nPower also increased by about 20 horsepower. A five-speed manual was standard, but most buyers went for the optional four-speed automatic. \n\nLater in this generation’s lifecycle, a 2.4-liter four-cylinder with 160 horsepower was added. \n\nNew features included a height-adjustable driver’s seat, stability control, and a six-disc CD changer. \n\nFor the first time, a Sport Package was offered.

But the model proved to be a success and encouraged competition like the Honda CR-V and Ford Escape.\n\nThe RAV4 EV was an all-electric model that was briefly offered to government fleets in 1997, then to the public in 2003. It used a 27kWh battery pack with a top speed of 85 mph and an estimated range of 95 miles.\n\n[View 1st Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-rav4#year_min=1996&year_max=2001)",

Some buyers want a safe vehicle, others wish for added performance for a specific purpose, and still, others want a new car with the latest technology. However, most people want reliable vehicles that they won't have to be taking to the shop continually. There's no doubt that some brands are more reliable than others. J.D. Power rates the most reliable vehicles using a one-to-five scale. \n\nConsumer Reports tracks the most reliable car brands. According to that publication, Toyota and Lexus are consistently among the most reliable car brands. \n\n### JD Power Noteworthy Brand Rankings for 2018\n\n## [Lexus](https://www.autolist.com/lexus)\n\n![2018 Lexus NX300 007 AA7B81875B6108FD5ACCBBF91B3D052EF1ECB77A (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/17CDaskZLqLcXqqm7bpKeq/278463e2027876f5c767f1c5645bf135/2018_Lexus_NX300_007_AA7B81875B6108FD5ACCBBF91B3D052EF1ECB77A__1_.jpg) \n\nThe brand that consistently sits atop the Consumer Reports rankings with its top vehicle listed as the Lexus GX. It achieves a 4.5 average reliability score, and only a few vehicles drop below four out of five. Some of the higher ranked Lexus vehicles include the ES, RX and NX.\n\n## [Porsche](https://www.autolist.com/porsche)\n\n![high 911 carrera 4 2019 porsche ag (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2YGI1D7E5k8540vAR3qrM1/3c872db78b2cc9794c14aa1c5778dd40/high_911_carrera_4_2019_porsche_ag__1_.jpg) \n\nAlso achieving a 4.5 out of five average reliability score, Porsche is on the Consumer Reports list as well at number 11. The most reliable model there is listed as the Porsche 911. Porsche only sells a small stable of vehicles with only six on the market for 2018. According to U.S. News, these vehicles sit in the top for cars in their respective markets. None of the Porsche vehicles scored lower than four.\n\n## [Lincoln](https://www.autolist.com/lincoln)\n\n![2020-lincoln-aviator2 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1tAFZ7Wzb442DItYU2wPYS/eb3f3bf59e54d8984f9c3fe259a417ce/2020-lincoln-aviator2__1_.jpg) \n\nAlso competing in the luxury realm is Lincoln, and the American brand manages a solid 4.0 in average predicted reliability. None of the Lincoln vehicles fall below four in the J.D. Power rankings, but they tend to be outranked by higher performing competition.  \n\n## [Toyota](https://www.autolist.com/toyota)\n\n![2019 Toyota Adventure Ruby 007 CC02619DFF172B2D27F165D2C7234E032E85D751 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1RCbYRvxx9RskltTLOqWc8/a3bb915ae6b933bdddee217c9897ddfc/2019_Toyota_Adventure_Ruby_007_CC02619DFF172B2D27F165D2C7234E032E85D751__1_.jpg) \n\nAlthough known for years as one of the most reliable car brands, Toyota only manages a 3.9 as an average score. However, it is listed on the Consumer Reports list at number two with the Prius being the most reliable vehicle. Regardless of this score, Toyota has long been associated with vehicle dependability and is often the brand buyers turn to when they want a reliable new car.\n\n## [Mercedes-Benz](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes-benz)\n\n![F8A3183-1200x800 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5SbZIxNrOZyrbEplA05o7S/ba0f1bf0e0394d5a2f0be84bff2ec77f/_F8A3183-1200x800__1_.jpg) \n\nMercedes gets an average reliability score of 3.9, but it is not in the Consumer Reports top-15 list. However, the automaker has a reliable cadre of vehicles with most of them scoring four out of five from J.D. Power. \n\n## [Buick](https://www.autolist.com/buick)\n\n![2018-Buick-Enclave-001 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6ysVosrL13XKzWfcPg40VU/cfa2cff5ed968e383135b8fd8cc05b0a/2018-Buick-Enclave-001__1_.jpg) \n\nAlso sitting at 3.9 is Buick with several premium vehicles to choose. Buick is not on the Consumer Reports top fifteen top reliability list, however. Some of the highest ranking cars for Buick include the Cascada and the Enclave.\n\n## [Kia](https://www.autolist.com/kia)\n\n![15050 2020 Telluride (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6mku5FuU1n5zLB0nF8cVI2/50011f46122d7b9c7992f96ccd6d09a5/15050_2020_Telluride__1_.jpg) \n\nThe Korean automaker is well-known for its strong warranty with its basic one at five years or 60,000 miles and the powertrain at 10 years or 100,000 miles. The average reliability for Kia is 3.8, which puts it slightly above Honda. Consumer Reports puts Kia in at number five on its list with the Kia Sedona as the most reliable model. The Kia Soul is also a top-ranked vehicle, having earned the US News Best Compact Car for the Money award for the 2017 model year. One of the vehicles bringing Kia's score down is the Sedona, which J.D. Power ranks at 2.5 out of five.\n\n## [BMW](https://www.autolist.com/bmw)\n\n![P90374475 highRes the-new-bmw-x3-xdriv (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/prkmNbCZGk99GHW4jgbuX/304d9a9e1b1a3fa02fb1f75544adeea3/P90374475_highRes_the-new-bmw-x3-xdriv__1_.jpg) \n\nJust a smidgen above Honda is BMW with an average reliability score of 3.7. BMW also sits at number 8 on the Consumer Reports list with its most reliable vehicle being the BMW i3. All of BMW's vehicles score above average. Among the highest ranked is the 4 Series and the X6 midsize SUV.\n\n## [Honda](https://www.autolist.com/honda)\n\n![0T 047-1200x8002018 Honda Accord Sport 2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/zdKicQAEuL4mY704wtuF1/4ce9ff272af3802108e27c8f1456185e/0T_047-1200x8002018_Honda_Accord_Sport_2.jpg)\n\nRanking slightly above Chevrolet with an average reliability score of 3.6, Honda is also listed at 15 in the Consumer Reports list of the most reliable car brands. According to that publication, the most reliable Honda model is the Fit. Bringing Honda's score down is the Odyssey minivan, which ranks only 2.5 out of five. On the higher end of the rankings is the Honda Ridgeline pickup, which ranks 4.5 and is considered one of the top trucks on the market.\n\n## [Chevrolet](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet)\n\n![2019-Chevrolet-Silverado-HighCountry-045 (2) (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4bCu9JGpheud1T5McV0xoy/b0d414e5dda30c742a4b1ff0eb6de5e9/2019-Chevrolet-Silverado-HighCountry-045__2___1_.jpg) \n\nUpon averaging the individual reliability scores of Chevy vehicles, the brand achieves an average of 3.5 out of five. That makes the Chevy brand above average for reliability. For example, the Corvette's reliability is about average, but the subcompact Sonic brings the rate up with a four out of five reliability score.\n\n\n\n### Consumer Reports Top 15 Brands for 2018\n\nEvery year, Consumer Reports releases a comprehensive list for the most reliable car brands and the vehicles within. It's a handy guide for car buyers who are looking for the most reliable brands. Lexus and Toyota have been at the top of the list for six straight years including 2018. Lexus was given an average reliability score of 78 out of 100 while Toyota got 76. Mazda jumped the highest in the reliability rankings to sit at third place. , and they also hold a total of 11 out of the top 15. There are no American brands in the top 15 of this list, and nine brands are among the 10 least reliable. The following is the full list of Consumer Reports top 15 most reliable brands with reliability scores out of 100:\n\n1. [Lexus](https://www.autolist.com/lexus) - 78\n2. [Toyota](https://www.autolist.com/toyota) - 76\n3. [Mazda](https://www.autolist.com/mazda) - 69\n4. [Subaru](https://www.autolist.com/subaru) - 65\n5. [Kia](https://www.autolist.com/kia) - 61\n6.

[Hyundai](https://www.autolist.com/hyundai) - 57\n11. [Porsche](https://www.autolist.com/porsche) - 54\n12. [Genesis](https://www.autolist.com/genesis) - 52\n13. [Acura ](https://www.autolist.com/acura)- 51\n14. [Nissan](https://www.autolist.com/nissan) -51 \n15. [Honda](https://www.autolist.com/honda) - 50\n\nIn the case of Nissan and Honda, the luxury brands from these companies score higher than their flagship brand. It's easy to see why Toyota and Lexus hold their reputation for being extremely reliable vehicles. There is almost a 10 point difference between second-place Toyota and third-place Mazda.\n\n### Ten Least Reliable Brands \n\nAccording to Consumer Reports, the following vehicle brands are the least reliable brands on the market:\n\n1. [Lincoln](https://www.autolist.com/lincoln)\n2. [Dodge](https://www.autolist.com/dodge)\n3. [Jeep](https://www.autolist.com/jeep)\n4. [Chevrolet](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet)\n5.

[Cadillac](https://www.autolist.com/cadillac)\n10. [Volvo](https://www.autolist.com/volvo)\n\nWhen it comes to American automakers, Ford is the highest ranked by Consumer Reports, sitting at the 18th spot overall. \n\n### 2018 Most Reliable Vehicles\n\nIn addition to ranking the most reliable brands, Consumer Reports also has data on the most reliable individual vehicles, including these top ten:\n\n1. [Lexus GX](https://www.autolist.com/lexus-gx+460)\n2. [Toyota Prius C](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-prius+c)\n3. [Toyota Prius Prime](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-prius+prime)\n4. [Mazda MX-5 Miata](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-mx+5+miata)\n5. [Toyota Corolla](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-corolla)\n6. [Lexus NX](https://www.autolist.com/lexus-nx+200t)\n7. [Toyota Prius](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-prius)\n8. [Honda Fit](https://www.autolist.com/honda-fit)\n9. [Kia Sedona](https://www.autolist.com/kia-sedona)\n10. [Toyota Highlander](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-highlander)\n\nWith this list, it's easy to see why Toyota and Lexus dominate the top spots with so many reliable vehicles. Combined, the brands also take six out of 19 total categories from J.D. Power.\n\n### 2018 Least Reliable Vehicles\n\nAlong with the lowest ranked brands, Consumer Reports lists the least reliable vehicles as well. The ten worst cars include:\n\n1. [Honda Odyssey](https://www.autolist.com/honda-odyssey)\n2. [Volkswagen Atlas](https://www.autolist.com/volkswagen-atlas)\n3. [Buick Enclave](https://www.autolist.com/buick-enclave)\n4. [Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-silverado+2500hd)\n5. [Kia Cadenza](https://www.autolist.com/kia-cadenza)\n6. [Chevrolet Traverse](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-traverse)\n7. [Honda Clarity](https://www.autolist.com/honda-clarity+plug+in+hybrid)\n8. [Cadillac ATS](https://www.autolist.com/cadillac-ats)\n9. [Tesla Model X](https://www.autolist.com/tesla-model+x)\n10. [Ram 3500](https://www.autolist.com/dodge-ram+pickup+3500)\n\nIt's worth noting that J.D. Power ranks vehicles by category, so some of the vehicles that win categories there may still belong to the lowest rated brands in terms of overall reliability. For example, the Odyssey is the top performer in the minivan category there despite being ranked as one of Consumer Reports least reliable vehicles.",

In the U.S., it is only available as a sedan as the Gran Turismo hatchback model was discontinued. \n\nThis 5 Series uses a new platform shared with the larger 7 Series sedan, with stronger materials and a more advanced electrical system to support more technology. \n\nThe 530i uses a turbocharged four-cylinder engine with 248 horsepower, while the 540i uses a turbocharged six-cylinder with 335 horsepower. \n\nThese were followed by the 530e plug-in hybrid model, which also produces a combined 248 horsepower, but offers a small electric-only range. \n\nLater, the M550i was introduced with a turbocharged V8 engine and 523 horsepower. It came standard with all-wheel-drive, which was an option on all other models. \n\nWhen the full M5 appeared for 2019, it too used a turbocharged V8, this time with 610 horsepower or 617 on the Competition model. \n\nAll 5 Series models kept similar sizes, but used automatic transmissions and offered technology such as gesture control for the audio and infotainment functions. They also featured a driver assistance technology package that could perform minor steering corrections and automatically stop the vehicle at high speeds to minimize an impact.\n\n[View 7th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-5+series#year_min=2017&year_max)\n\n### 2011 - 2016 BMW 5 Series (F10 6th Generation)\n\n[![bmw5-series-6th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7cjLlZpKbwAncVaDPF5A8u/56ad915448af3ca77d5bed755c12f889/bmw5-series-6th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-5+series#year_min=2011&year_max=2016)\n\nFor its sixth iteration, the BMW 5 Series lost some of its controversial styling cues. While the sedan returned, the wagon was replaced in the U.S. by the Gran Turismo, a five-door hatchback with a longer wheelbase than the sedan’s. This new GT model was derided by critics for its awkward looks and questionable interior benefits. \n\nThe entire line of 5 Series models grew more advanced in terms of technology. Vehicles were offered with a 360-degree camera, rear-wheel steering, and a night vision camera. \n\nThe sedan range started with the turbocharged, four-cylinder 528i, then the turbocharged six-cylinder 535i and the 550i with a V8 turbo. \n\nAn M5 closely followed, swapping the previous V10 and available manual transmission for a turbocharged V8 and dual-clutch automated manual. \n\nTwo new variants also appeared for the first time in this generation. The first was a diesel, the 535d, powered by a turbocharged six-cylinder engine. \n\nLater the ActiveHybrid5 was the first gas-electric hybrid model offered on the 5 Series.\n\n[View 6th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-5+series#year_min=2011&year_max=2016)\n\n### 2004 - 2010 BMW 5 Series (E60 5th Generation)\n\n[![bmw5-series-5th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4whMUVVfLvGi5s1Lp5eRWK/6f7917429ab5e08c087ca2ccdcb17b9b/bmw5-series-5th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-5+series#year_min=2004&year_max=2010)\n\nThe fifth-generation 5 Series had a lot to live up to, following the acclaim its predecessor earned. BMW decided to incorporate plenty of radical elements with the E60, however. \n\nThe styling, which aped the equally controversial 7 Series from two years prior, didn’t hide the fact this 5 was much larger than the old one. \n\nInside, the relatively simple controls of the previous model were replaced by BMW’s iDrive. It was one of the first extensive infotainment systems in a new car that was a screen controlled by a central knob and voice commands, and it was roundly panned by critics and owners alike in its early years. \n\nNevertheless, the iDrive was indicative of the level of technology the 5 Series offered, as many of its features are still making their way into cars today. Adaptive cruise control was a new feature, as was active steering, Bluetooth, and push-button start with keyless entry to start. \n\nThe 530i (in sedan and wagon) kept a version of its previous six-cylinder engine, but a new 545i offered a larger V8 before. Later, the 535i replaced the 530i, and a 550i supplanted the 545i. \n\nAll-wheel-drive was newly available, and the transmissions consisted of six-speed manuals and automatics. \n\nThe M5 swapped in an enormous V10 engine that jumped horsepower a full 100 to 500 horsepower. It used an automated manual transmission, but customer complaints prompted the introduction of a six-speed manual midway through its life. \n\nWhile the E60 set the mold for the future of the 5 Series, it may not be considered the most loved by loyalists.\n\n[View 5th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-5+series#year_min=2004&year_max=2010)\n\n### 1997 - 2003 BMW 5 Series (E39 4th Generation)\n\n[![bmw5-series-4th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5JmugSt1nUiISKewnFHoHn/656e6b606b629c5d8e695a93d3701064/bmw5-series-4th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-5+series#year_min=1997&year_max=2003)\n\nThis may be the most loved generation by purists and BMW fanatics. The fourth-generation 5 Series, known as the E39, debuted in early 1996 as a 1997 model. It represented a significant step up over its long-lived predecessor but boasted several interesting derivatives. \n\nIt launched as the 528i sedan with a traditional BMW inline six-cylinder engine. \n\nA 540i with a V8 closely followed, including a Sport model with the V8 and a six-speed manual. \n\nThe wagon variant came in 1999, also available in 528i and 540i models. \n\nAnd in 2000, the M5 returned with a V8 engine and 400 horsepower, an unheard of combination even for a manufacturer like BMW. \n\nEven more unexpected were the amenities in this generation 5 Series. Anti-lock brakes and traction control and xenon headlamps were commonplace, but satellite navigation was introduced midway through the car’s run. In addition to dual front airbags, side airbags appeared as did airbags that protected the head. BMW was the first manufacturer to introduce such a system that is now standard on nearly all vehicles. \n\nThe E39 earned also earned high praise for its neat and timeless looks and the way it drove, even when the last models were being produced. It is a modern classic.\n\n[View 4th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-5+series#year_min=1997&year_max=2003)\n\n### 1989 - 1995 BMW 5 Series (E34 3rd Generation)\n\n[![bmw5-series-3rd-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5pUFdJQDodEG8EtZ0ogsUt/3db19609c7560bf5e582d34b4bad2366/bmw5-series-3rd-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-5+series#year_min=1989&year_max=1995)\n\nThe third-generation 5 Series represented a significant advancement on its predecessor, and a sign BMW was becoming a serious player in a field traditionally dominated by Mercedes-Benz. \n\nFollowing the technologically advanced 7 Series, this new 5 Series not only looked a lot like the larger car but also inherited some of its features. This model was more spacious than its predecessor, but also got features like airbags and, later, V8 engines. \n\nIt launched as the 525i and 535i, both with six-cylinder engines. \n\nIn 1990, the M5 returned with a six-cylinder engine and more than 300 horsepower. But for 1993, two V8s became available in the forms of the 530i and 540i, as did a wagon variant was offered for the first time to compete with offerings from Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo. \n\nThe E34 received constant refinement over its life, resulting in a car that was still a reasonably accomplished product. Perhaps that set the tone for the follow-up. \n\n[View 3rd Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-5+series#year_min=1989&year_max=1995)\n\n### 1982 - 1988 BMW 5 Series (E28 2nd Generation)\n\n[![bmw5-series-2nd-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1HeV0XqOAae1PTNP5F0O18/73840452f3c6f488bda2dc97c873feb6/bmw5-series-2nd-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-5+series#year_min=1982&year_max=1988)\n\nBMW upgraded the second-generation 5 Series for 1982 with the E28. Keeping the same styling cues as its predecessor, the E28 brought new features, more luxury, and, eventually, a lot more performance. \n\nThe car launched with the 528e using a 121-horsepower six-cylinder engine, but more powerful 533i and 535i models quickly followed to compete with ever-powerful luxury cars following the fuel crisis. \n\nA diesel was offered for the first time as the 524td, but it was unpopular and dropped in 1986. \n\nYet a now-revered E28 variant was a high-performance version known as the M5. For 1987, BMW gave this generation a runout special by putting aggressive spoilers and black trim on a sedan with a 256-horsepower six-cylinder engine and five-speed manual transmission. To casual observers, it looked like a typical 5 Series, but enthusiasts knew it was one of the quickest sedans of its day. \n\nThey are highly sought-after vehicles now. \n\nAnd the 5 Series line continued its march towards cementing its status as, well, a status symbol. \n\n[View 2nd Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-5+series#year_min=1982&year_max=1988)\n\n### 1975 - 1981 BMW 5 Series (E12 1st Generation)\n\n[![bmw5-series-1st-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1mYWOPoYCs1TvoRe0fYfKW/821426e883a1850ab963009500dd214a/bmw5-series-1st-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-5+series#year_min=1975&year_max=1981)\n\nThe introduction of the 5 Series marked the start of a new era for BMW. Having established itself in the 1960s with sporty coupes and sedans, BMW sought to continue pushing into the luxury market and be taken seriously with the likes of Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz, while being more youthful than the Cadillacs and Lincolns that still dominated American roads. \n\nTo do this, the original 530i featured a fuel-injected six-cylinder engine with 176 horsepower, impressive considering many American cars were struggling to get similar power out of a V8 then. A five-speed manual was standard, but a three-speed automatic was available. \n\nThe 5 Series wasn’t immune to emissions restrictions, however, and the 1979 528i received a catalytic converter and five fewer horsepower. \n\nNevertheless, these early 5 Series models helped attract attention to BMW and the company’s competence that it could replicate what it did with its early sports sedans and move that into the luxury sector. \n\n[View 1st Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-5+series#year_min=1975&year_max=1981)",

      "body": "In the U.S., most states levy a sales tax when you buy a new vehicle. If you buy a car out-of-state and bring it to your home state, though, it's not always clear which state should receive the tax, since tax laws vary by state. Before you go car buying across state lines, make sure you know how to pay the state sales tax correctly, so you don't get a tax evasion fine.\n\n__If I Buy a Car in Another State, Where Do I Pay Sales Tax?__\n\nTypically, when you buy a car in a different state than your home state, the dealer collects your sales tax and sends it to the relevant agency in your home state. That way, you don't have to deal with the fuss of trying to follow each state's tax laws. \n\nBefore the Department of Motor Vehicles in your home state can register your new car, they may check the bill of sale to ensure you paid the sales tax, so you shouldn't try to skimp on paying it. Dealers often tax out-of-state buyers the amount they'd pay if they lived there, so you may have to make up the difference if your home state's tax rate is higher. \n\nTo avoid confusion when you register at the DMV, make sure you get a bill of sale for your vehicle purchase with the tax included. You don't want to pay a second sales tax just because the dealer forgot to send the appropriate paperwork to your local DMV. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that there are approximately 10,000 sales tax jurisdictions in the U.S., including cities, counties and other districts, and each jurisdiction has its own tax laws. You may have to pay local taxes on top of state ones.\n\n![shutterstock 1392219677 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6PFOOrhz70q3MU2Quv9inY/552ca0e3370ff630eb1f3ad57b8ab933/shutterstock_1392219677__1_.jpg)\n\n__How Much Sales Tax Do I Need to Pay for My Motor Vehicle?__\n\nHow much sales tax you need to pay depends on the laws of your home state and the state in which you bought the car. \n\nSome states have reciprocal tax relationships, meaning they provide credits to each other whenever their residents pay sales taxes across state lines. For example, Arizona has reciprocal tax agreements with Oregon, Virginia, Indiana and California. If a California resident buys a car in Arizona, they may be exempt from paying the sales tax in Arizona, though they must still pay it in California. Your state's DMV most likely lists the state's tax relationships with other states, so you should check their web page before making a purchase. \n\nEven if you visit a non-reciprocal state, you may be able to avoid paying the sales tax in that state if you give the dealer proof that you intend to register your car in your home state, such as your driver's license. \n\nIf you buy your car from a private seller instead of a dealer, you can pay the sales tax when you register the vehicle in your home state. If you take this approach, though, the DMV in your home state may need to check the car's vehicle identification number to ensure it matches the out-of-state title.\n\nWhen transferring cars between states, remember that legal differences between states extend beyond taxes. Some states require a smog test before registering a vehicle to ensure it meets emissions requirements. The California Air Resources Board is notably stringent in this respect. \n\nSimilarly, safety standards between states often clash. If you buy a car in another state, there's no guarantee you can register it in your home state, even if you've already paid for the vehicle and all associated taxes. Also, car taxes between states vary widely. As of 2019, New York has a car tax rate of 4 percent plus local taxes, whereas Pennsylvania has a state car tax rate of 6 percent, with some local rates much higher. \n\n![shutterstock 1441462949 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4keHRJO8GioqXSGoCVDK0e/58654f0da0b997c193e6ddedba61ddde/shutterstock_1441462949__1_.jpg)\n\n__What About Special Circumstances?__\n\nBecause U.S. state tax laws vary so much, there are many individual circumstances to take into account when buying a car in another state. Most states provide tax credits for trade-ins — that is when you give your old car to a dealer to cover part of the cost of a new car. \n\nHowever, California, Michigan, Oklahoma, Virginia and District of Columbia don't do this. \n\nAlso, if you buy a used car instead of a new one, you must still pay a sales tax. You don't need to pay the tax to the dealer or private party when buying the used car, but you do need to pay it when you register the vehicle in your home state. \n\nSome states, such as California, charge use fees when you bring in a car from out-of-state, even if you've already paid the sales tax on the vehicle. In Oklahoma, you must pay an excise tax on the car's value when you register it. \n\nSome states charge yearly excise fees for cars or a fee whenever you renew your registration. These fees are in addition to the sales tax you must pay.\n\n__What Are Some Loopholes to Avoid Paying Sales Tax on Cars?__\n\nSales taxes on cars are often hefty, so you may try to avoid paying them. The easiest way to do so is to buy a car in a state with no sales taxes and register the car there. \n\nThere are five states without sales taxes: Montana, Alaska, Delaware, Oregon and New Hampshire. \n\nUnfortunately, unless you register the vehicle in the sales-tax-free state, you still have to pay the sales tax when you register the car in your home state, and using dummy addresses doesn't fool revenue departments. If you plan to move from a state without sales taxes to one with sales taxes, you should buy the car and register it about three months before your move. This way, you don't have to pay a sales tax on your vehicle in the new state when you re-register it. \n\nThere are other loopholes, too. Cars built before 1973 are typically exempt from sales taxes, and vehicles used for certain types of farming are as well. You also don't need to pay the sales tax if you're disabled. Just make sure you include a tax exemption disc on your vehicle to display your status. \n\nFinally, you may receive tax deductions on your vehicle if you add it in your tax filing, such as if your car meets low-emission criteria. These deductions can mitigate the sales tax you have to pay when buying the car.\n\nSales taxes are tricky when you buy a car out-of-state. Generally, you pay the dealer the sales tax, and the dealer sends the revenue to your home state, but exceptions abound. Make sure you consult your local DMV before making a purchase across state lines.",

      "body": "When you're car shopping, you may run across the phrase \"continuously variable transmission\" or CVT. Why might you choose a CVT versus a conventional automatic transmission? \n\nSome drivers believe a CVT provides a smoother experience compared to a traditional automatic transmission or a manual transmission. But the biggest advantage is that they're more fuel efficient than a conventional automatic; this is why you've seen automakers put them in dozens of models in the past decade. \n\nCompare the pros and cons of a CVT vs. automatic type of transmission and make the better choice for your needs.\n\n### How Manual vs. Automatic Transmissions Work\n\nWhen you're driving a car with a manual transmission, such as a sports car or vintage vehicle, you use the stick shift on the car's console or steering column to maneuver between transmission gears, while simultaneously using your left foot to depress the clutch pedal. Gears are numbered from one to as many as seven, plus a single reverse gear. As the engine's revolutions per minute (RPM) increase or decrease, you shift to the next highest gear or next lowest gear. This continues to match an appropriate engine speed with the vehicle's speed as it accelerates or decelerates.\n\nYou work less when driving an automatic transmission car. The transmission shifts on its own; you simply select Park, Neutral, Reverse or Drive and the transmission does the rest. It matches the engine and road speeds automatically.\n\n ![shutterstock 259933073 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/44bI4CWqcAfaJ7fOqn54vj/7b597680f903d47d8e767ffcf196e7f2/shutterstock_259933073__1_.jpg)\n\nAutomakers build automatic gearboxes with a wide range of gears; older models have as few as three while more recently some brands have patented transmissions with 11. This allows the engine to operate at the most appropriate speed as it relates to the vehicle speed, ensuring the best fuel economy. \n\nIn recent decades, vehicles with conventional automatic transmissions have gained wide popularity over manual transmissions in the U.S. Automatic transmissions make learning to drive easier, require less attention when driving, and create less engine wear and tear.\n\n### How a CVT Works\n\nUnlike conventional automatic transmissions, continuously variable transmissions don't have any gears. A CVT uses two cone-shaped pulleys. One pulley is connected to the engine and the other is connected to the rest of the transmissions. A steel or composite belt connects the two pulleys. \n\nThe pulleys change widths depending on how much power the wheels need from the engine. As one pulley gets larger, the other gets smaller. This design enables a CVT-powered car to accelerate with strength and smoothness. \n\n### Variations on CVTs\n\nCVTs are not all the same. One variation is a different, less common CVT style using rollers and discs. \n\nBecause CVTs don't have any gears, they don't shift at the common times that an automatic will when the vehicle is accelerating. This lack of shift points can be unnerving for drivers and passengers used to the behavior of a common automatic. To combat this, many brands that rely on CVTs have programmed into their behavior artificial shift points that give drivers the feel of transmission shifting. \n\n![shutterstock 720193909 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1xjGYhX0ZAzwcsq2PzvLsp/1e65e1c83f38f582305e8b6869c0db5b/shutterstock_720193909__1_.jpg) \n\nThe Subaru Ascent SUV is one example (among many) that have this feature. The Ascent features eight preset shift points on the pulley system making it seem as if the car is shifting gears. Drivers either click on paddles mounted on the steering wheel or move the shift lever. \n\nOther models with CVTs have a conventional first gear like normal automatics and then a CVT handles the rest. \n\nCalled a “launch gear,\" this actual gear controls the car's initial acceleration; the transmission switches to the continuously variable transmission mode at 25 miles per hour. \n\nThe 2019 model year Toyota Corolla Hatchback has this setup and Toyota says it enables the car to achieve stronger and smoother acceleration from the start.\n\n### Pros of CVT vs Automatic Transmission\n\nA key benefit of the CVT is its ability to change its gear ratio continuously as the engine speed changes. This means the engine is always operating at its peak efficiency. \n\nA CVT draws top engine power from a small engine, which gives drivers quicker acceleration than standard automatic transmissions.\n\nBecause of their greater ability to control the engine speed range, CVTs produce fewer emissions. CVTs are also lighter weight than traditional automatic transmissions. You get better fuel economy, especially in city driving.\n\nAs for the driving experience, some drivers comment that the CVT car ride is extremely smooth compared to normal automatic transmissions. They like that they notice RPM or engine speed changes only when the car is cruising or accelerating.\n\n### Cons of CVTs vs. Automatics\n\nSome drivers miss the engine shifts and acceleration of the traditional automatic transmission experience. There's no sound or sense of running through the gears as with conventional automatic transmissions. Although the engine maintains its high speed, you hear only a humming or droning sound. Because a CVT may keep an engine running at higher RPM when an automatic would have shifted to a higher gear, CVT-equipped vehicles can make it seem like the engine is droning loudly under hard acceleration. \n\n![shutterstock 786709315 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7q3tugqQ119lCboDT7pfcr/fcee471eaf1ff103147b6c724c381112/shutterstock_786709315__1_.jpg) \n\nServicing a CVT is different from servicing an automatic transmission. CVTs need special oil, transmission fluid, and parts. You have to take a CVT-equipped vehicle to a service department with a mechanic skilled in transmission repair and maintenance for this type of transmission. Owners of CVT-equipped vehicles find transmission repair is more expensive for them compared to automatic transmission repair or replacement.\n\nOther common problems CVT-equipped vehicle owners report include the occasional sudden loss of acceleration and overheating. Drivers complain of jerking, slipping, and shuddering. CVT belts can suffer excessive stretching and wear. Some owners have experienced transmission failure. Lawsuits against car makers claim the equipment performs unreliably.\n\n### Vehicles Using CVTs\n\nJapanese automakers use CVTs more than European and domestic car makers. Mitsubishi, Subaru, and Nissan were particularly early and eager adopters of CVTs and the brands feature them in most, if not all of their cars and SUVs, including the Nissan Altima and the Nissan Murano. \n\nToyota and Honda now include CVTs in more models, including the latest generations of Honda Civic and Honda Accord. Other CVT-equipped vehicles include Honda CR-V, Honda Accord, Nissan Rogue, and several Mitsubishi models. Domestic cars featuring CVTs include the 2011 Ford Fusion Hybrid. \n\nTo find out which type of transmission is in a particular car, check the automaker’s website or a printed vehicle brochure. If it's a new vehicle, look at the window sticker. Used cars may require more product review research.\n\n### Which is best for you\n\nChoosing between a CVT vs. automatic is a matter of personal taste. You might prefer the road feel of the conventional automatic transmission. If maximum fuel economy matters, you might prefer the CVT. \n\nDo your research and above all else -- take a test drive to decide what's right for you.",

Either way, we help break down which states, like Texas, California and Ohio, etc. require the oft-dreaded front license plate and how people try to get around it.\n\n### There are 31 states plus Washington D.C. that require a front license plate. \n\n__The states are as follows:__\n- Alaska\n- California\n- Colorado\n- Connecticut\n- Hawaii\n- Idaho\n- Illinois\n- Iowa\n- Maine\n- Maryland\n- Massachusetts\n- Minnesota\n- Missouri\n- Montana\n- Nebraska\n- Nevada\n- New Hampshire\n- New Jersey\n- New York\n- North Dakota\n- Ohio\n- Oregon\n- Rhode Island\n- South Dakota\n- Texas\n- Utah\n- Vermont\n- Virginia\n- Washington\n- Wisconsin\n- Wyoming\n\nAlmost all of these states are in the northern part of the country, with the exception of Texas and Hawaii.

States that do not require front license plates are largely located in the south and east portion of the country. \n\nIn some of the states where the front plate is required, the law is unpopular, particularly among sports car owners who dislike marring the front of their vehicle with a license plate.\n\n![shutterstock 1644518881 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4n6Ydf8xafhFjY4jgTSDzL/917cb738040835c0663f109704f41eca/shutterstock_1644518881__1_.jpg)\n\n### States Without A Front Plate Law\n\nEvery state requires at least a rear license plate, but as previously mentioned, there are 19 states that do not require a front plate. These states are:\n\n- Alabama\n- Arizona\n- Arkansas\n- Delaware\n- Florida\n- Georgia\n- Indiana\n- Kansas\n- Kentucky\n- Louisiana\n- Michigan\n- Mississippi\n- New Mexico\n- North Carolina\n- Oklahoma\n- Pennsylvania\n- South Carolina\n- Tennessee\n- West Virginia\n\n### Why Some Car Owners Dislike Front Plates\n\nThere's no doubt that plenty of drivers in front plate states don't even think about their cars requiring or needing front plates. Drivers who own sports cars, classic cars and high-end luxury vehicles often object to the front plate law because of how it detracts from the appearance of their vehicle. One of the reasons for this is that some vehicles were never designed to allow for a front license plate. Classic cars are a great example of this, but there are exotic foreign cars that also fall under this category too. \n\n### Ways Drivers Get Around the Front Plate Law\n\nSome drivers attempt to circumvent the plate law by placing their plate in the window or by keeping it somewhere else inside the car, such as in the glove box or on the floor. However, laws tend to state that the plate must be in a fully visible location on the car. Some states have various exceptions in place, such as Washington state, which allows for exceptions in the case of vehicles that do not have front locations specifically built for a front plate. In order to qualify for such an exemption, you have to write the Washington State Patrol and ask for a waiver.\n\n![shutterstock 1648196989 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/JsdNuhctWnfAZcMzls6Iu/1442a65b4b815009301c3185e43f1c55/shutterstock_1648196989__1_.jpg)\n\n### Penalties for Disobeying the Front Plate Law\n\nPolice will often pull over drivers who do not carry a front plate if the state requires it. The penalties vary by state. Sometimes a ticket is issued immediately and other times the driver may receive a verbal warning. Fines for this violation are usually between $100 and $200. \n\nAnother method is the fix-it ticket. This means that you initially get a ticket, but if you add the plate and then verify it with your local police department, the ticket will be canceled. If you're determined to drive without a front plate, the good news is that equipment tickets such as this rarely affect car insurance rates.\n\nIn some states, vehicles parked on the street with no visible plate can get a parking ticket from the local parking authority. These fines often vary and can be as little as $25. \n\n### How Front Plates Create Financial Impacts\n\nIt's not just drivers who object to required front plates on cars, but also lawmakers in some states. They argue that manufacturing and distributing front plates costs more than it's worth. However, due to the fines levied on violations of the law, other lawmakers argue that the plates pay for themselves. For example, in Denver, a particular toll road generates up to a third of its revenue by scanning front license plates. States not requiring front plates often see a large number of toll violators due to unreadable rear plates. \n\nThe Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport in Arizona calculates parking fees with Automated License Plate Recognition. But due to glare on the rear license plates, it is forced to determine fees on up to 15 percent of vehicles by hand rather than automatically. Naturally, this requires more manpower and paying workers to go out and take down license plates.\n\n\n![shutterstock 1612428694 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6B1d5oPvcNUdpiC36JdVsa/920fd6ffd6ea3af3cab491ae33c77678/shutterstock_1612428694__1_.jpg)\n\n### Front Plate Laws and Crime-Fighting\n\nProponents of front plates argue that they make the public safer. Two plates generally make it easier to find stolen cars, according to the police. License Plate Reader systems are used by the police to identify stolen cars and cars whose owners have outstanding violations or arrest warrants. The police use this technology by taking pictures of passing vehicles with a high-speed camera. The reader identifies the plate numbers and checks them against a hot list. LPR systems are able to read 10,000 plates in about eight hours. If the LPR is only able to work with a rear plate, that number falls by half. Another area where this applies is when victims or bystanders need to read the plate numbers of a vehicle leaving the scene of a crime or accident. When only one plate is required, it makes it more difficult for the authorities and witnesses to correctly identify the plate.\n\n### Other License Plate Laws\n\nLicense plate laws regarding both plates are generally straightforward. Plates need to be valid and fully visible. They need to be properly mounted on the car in the designated space without obstruction. All numbers, letters and other identification on the plate should be fully visible. Plates should not be muddy or marred with debris, and some states even ban plastic covers due to the glare they cause. Drivers are not allowed to customize their plates by cutting them or filing down the edges. Car manufacturers and dealers are not allowed to distribute vehicles with only one plate in states that require two plates.\n\nOccasionally license plate laws come up for debate in state governments. In 2017, several states attempted to introduce bills to amend license plate laws in the two-plate states. The laws were largely aimed at historic vehicles that lacked space for a front plate.\n\n### Cars Never Designed for Front Plates\n\nAs mentioned above, many older cars were never designed for front license plates.

      "body": "### What is the difference between all-wheel-drive (AWD) and front-wheel drive (FWD)?\n\nThe main difference is where the engine sends power. In FWD vehicles, the engine only powers the front axle, whereas, in AWD vehicles, the engine powers both front and rear axles.\n\n__Here's a brief rundown on the four types of wheel drive systems:__\n\n__Front-Wheel-Drive:__ The vast majority of new cars on the road today are front-wheel drive vehicles, including almost all models of SUVs. Front-wheel drive SUVs come equipped with additional parts that automatically route some of the engine's power to the rear axle when necessary. Since the drivetrain is positioned in the front and pulls the weight of the vehicle, the effect of oversteer (rear end of the vehicle sliding out and causing a tighter turn than intended) is limited. FWD cars are good at climbing hills and perform well in slippery conditions. From a manufacturer's standpoint, FWD vehicles are beneficial because they are cheaper to manufacture and use space more efficiently. \n\n__Rear-Wheel-Drive:__ Rear-drive systems are usually found in sports cars, pickup trucks, older truck-based SUVs and luxury high-performance sedans. It is a two-wheel drive system that pushes the car from the rear axle. Rear-wheel drive systems (RWD) enable better handling in performance cars by distributing weight more evenly. Also, since the front wheels aren't in charge of both steering and powering the vehicle, makers of rear-wheel-drive vehicles are free to tune the suspension system for handling superiority. These days, most performance RWD cars typically have AWD options available as well. RWD trucks are made with robust and heavy parts that provide better traction when hauling a heavy load. RWD vehicles have inferior traction control when road conditions are slippery, however. \n\n__All-Wheel-Drive:__ AWD systems deliver power to each corner of the vehicle, similar to 4WD cars. However, unlike 4WD cars, AWD is always engaged and provides varying amounts of power to the axles depending on traction conditions. All-wheel drive systems primarily power one set of axles, either front or rear. When the car feels traction loss in one axle, it will automatically divert more power to the other axle to compensate. Not all AWD systems utilize the same power ratio. For example, Subaru's all-wheel-drive system continuously sends at least 20% of the engines power output to the rear axle, with the possibility of directing more if necessary. Other systems exclusively power the front axle and only rebalance engine output to the rear when the front tires are losing traction.\n\nAWD cars work well in moderate off-road driving situations, or when driving conditions are prone to change due to terrain variation or volatile weather conditions. In addition, AWD vehicles provide great overall traction during acceleration due to all four wheels being engaged. AWD systems are commonly found in car-based SUVs and minivans, but also often make an appearance as an option for performance rear-wheel-drive cars.\n\n__Four-Wheel Drive:__ Four-wheel drive (4WD) cars are generally tuned for extreme off-road uses like traversing over deep water, scaling boulders or climbing steep hills with poor surface traction. When enabled, 4WD systems send power to all four wheels using front and rear differentials plus a transfer case that distributes power equally regardless of traction. In addition, some 4WD have two gear ranges, high and low. The low gear range proves especially helpful when low-speed climbing power is required. There are three different mode toggle options in modern four-wheel drive vehicles. Full-time systems are always engaged, automatic systems switch between 2WD and 4WD automatically, and part-time systems require the driver to switch between two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive modes manually. Driving a part-time 4WD vehicle on the pavement with 4WD enabled can cause damage to the vehicle's drivetrain.\n\n__Is an All-Wheel-Drive or Four-Wheel-Drive vehicle worth it?__\n\nIt depends on the driving conditions you plan to encounter. Two-wheel-drive cars handle rain and light snowfall just fine, with front-wheel-drive cars generally eking out rear-wheel cars in safety. Rear-wheel-drive cars excel when performance is critical (although all-wheel-drive systems can provide more traction). All-wheel drive vehicles are great for light off-road driving and typical snow conditions. If you're powering through heavy snow or tackling extreme off-road terrain, a four-wheel-drive vehicle with high ground clearance and a low gear range is the set of wheels you should be looking for.\n\nIn addition to weather and terrain conditions, fuel efficiency is another factor that should be considered. Both four-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive systems contribute substantial heft to the vehicle, so you end up trading efficient fuel economy for that extra traction. And sending power to all four wheels when it isn't necessary also contributes to more drag and reduced efficiency. Some all-wheel-drive systems now automatically disconnect power going to the rear axle when the system determines the front two have sufficient traction.\n\n__Traversing Winter Terrain__\n\nSafety and handling is another concern. Many potential car buyers view all-wheel drive and four-wheel drive SUVs as safer due to the increased traction they provide. However, that straight traction contributes absolutely nothing to assist in safer turning or braking, especially when ice is a factor. Sure, the robust traction is helpful when you need to get going, but stopping is another story. Four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive cars are involved in icier condition-related accidents than their lighter two-wheel drive counterparts, and their drivers' misconceptions about the limitations of their 4WD and AWD drivetrains certainly plays a part. Even on dry streets, heavier four-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive vehicles require more distance to come to a complete halt. \n\nWhen driving through winter weather, you can't go wrong with a set of winter tires. Numerous independent studies have shown that good tires play the largest part in determining a vehicle's safety performance when driving through snow and ice. That is because snow tires are made from a softer kind of rubber than standard tires. Their more pliable texture enables superior traction when the temperature drops. Besides, winter tires feature specialized treads that are designed to carve into the snow and eject it out of the way. Snow tires are embossed with a three-peak mountain and snowflake logo, so it's easy to see if the tire you're looking at passes snow performance standards and is rated for winter driving. \n\n### To Sum it Up:\n\nIf you are mainly looking to drive in the city, a two-wheel drive car is all you need. Throw a set of winter tires on when going through light snowfall and it will perform fine. This is the cheapest option, since all-wheel drive vehicles are more expensive right out of the dealer and less fuel efficient, leading to increased expenses down the line. A front-wheel drive vehicle is more versatile and less prone to oversteer. If you live in a warm, dry climate and are a performance enthusiast, a rear-wheel-drive car might be right for you.\n\nWhen you want a mix of urban driving and rural performance, nothing beats the versatility of an all-wheel-drive vehicle. All-wheel-drive cars are jacks-of-all-trades and can weather harsh winter conditions when equipped with a good set of snow tires. All-wheel drive cars also redistribute power automatically, so you don't have to worry about fumbling with controls and can focus on the road.\n\nFor heavy high incline off-roading and trudging through unplowed roads, a four-wheel drive car with a low gear range and high clearance provides the best mobility. Just remember to enable the right settings for the terrain, as failing to do so can damage your drivetrain.",

      "body": "Buying a car is expensive and it can be even more expensive if you live in a state that tacks on additional fees and sales tax. It can be significantly less expensive to own a car in certain states, such as Florida or New Hampshire, than in more expensive states like California or New York. \n\nSome of the cheapest states to buy a used car and own a car are Florida, Oregon, New Hampshire, Virginia, Ohio, Wisconsin, Missouri and North Carolina. Here's a look at why.\n\n__Best State Based on Initial Cost of a Used Car: Florida__\nOne of the first things to consider when purchasing a new car is the initial cost. The price of a new or used car is not standard across all states so shopping around and know the facts can be beneficial. When looking for a used car, Florida has some of the cheapest options available.  As of 2016, used vehicles cost almost 10 percent less in Florida than they do nationwide. With an older population, more drivers sell their vehicles than in other states so there are more opportunities to purchase used cars at a more affordable price. Wealthier residents in areas like Miami also sell their vehicles more frequently so it is a buyers' market for several reasons in Florida. Plus, most of these vehicles have never seen snowy conditions and the salt used to melt the snow, so they are often in great condition. \n\n__Best State Based on Unexpected Fees: Oregon__\nInitial cost is not the only factor to consider when purchasing a new car. There are multiple fees to keep in mind when purchasing a car and they can really add up. The initial fees that come into play when first buying a car will only run you up to a maximum of $130 in Oregon as of 2018, which is significantly cheaper than most other states. \n\nThose who reside in Alaska and New Hampshire also do not have to worry about exorbitant fees. The maximum in those states is only approximately $360. This compares to some of the more expensive states which can cost up to $2,350. Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, and Tennessee have some of the highest fees in this regard.\n\n### Best States to Own a Car\nThe sticker price of the car and the associated fees are not the only thing to keep in mind when buying a new car. There are several maintenance and insurance fees to consider as well.\n\n__New Hampshire__\nNew Hampshire has some of the most affordable fees. As of 2016, the one-time initial fee associated with the purchase is just $25. The average annual cost of ownership and using a car in New Hampshire, including auto insurance and gas costs, is $2,691. \n\nOne of the great things about getting a car in New Hampshire is that there is no sales tax for vehicle purchases which can save you a lot of money upfront. Only four other states have no sales tax on vehicle purchases: Oregon, Delaware, Montana and Alaska. \n\nInsurance premiums are quite low in New Hampshire as well, coming in at approximately $941 annually in 2016, and an average of $337 a year for the cost of repairs.\n\n__Missouri__\nThe initial purchase fees are not particularly inexpensive in Missouri, but the state does have some of the cheapest gas prices in the U.S. which lowers overall ownership and transportation costs. \n\nIn general, Missouri residents pay less than the average American for the majority of car-related expenses including registration and title fees, as well as auto insurance and costs associated with upkeep and maintenance.\n\n__North Carolina__\nAs of 2016, North Carolina has a car sales tax of 3 percent, which is lower than most other states. Insurance is relatively inexpensive in this state as are registration and title fees. \n\nNorth Carolina is also an affordable place to buy and insure a new vehicle, but it is important to keep in mind that maintenance costs are particularly high so upkeep can cost you.\n\n__Wisconsin__\nCar ownership is particularly inexpensive in Wisconsin. With lower insurance premiums, car maintenance fees, and gas prices, Wisconsin has the second-lowest car ownership costs in the United States as of 2016. One-time purchase fees are higher in Wisconsin than in Missouri and North Carolina, but the lower ownership fees can offset this overall cost.\n\n__Ohio__\nAs of 2016, the Ohio sales tax rate for cars is 5.75 percent. That's a bit higher than some of the other states on the list and can raise initial and overall costs. But the sales tax may be offset by the lower insurance premiums in Ohio, which are the second-lowest out of all 50 states, in addition to lower gas prices and car maintenance fees.\n\n__Virginia__\nVirginia does have some of the most expensive repair costs in the country so maintaining a vehicle can cost owners a significant amount of money. However, auto insurance premiums and gas prices are relatively inexpensive when compared with other states. The initial purchasing fees, including registration and title fees, are also cheaper in Virginia than in Ohio.\n\n### Shopping Around\nIt's important to realize that car prices can fluctuate and certain models of cars may be less expensive in some states for a variety of reasons. Knowing the make and model of the car you want can offer more opportunities for savings. \n\nFor example, listing prices on Honda CR-Vs tend to be much cheaper in Maine and Delaware than in other states, while a Toyota Camry tends to be particularly inexpensive in Kentucky (probably because they're built there). \n\nThe best deals on a Ford F-150 are often found in Missouri or Rhode Island. \n\nAlthough shopping in different states for lower prices can help save money, keep in mind that states have different registration fees and sales tax that can drive up the cost. Remember to factor long-term maintenance costs into your car budget as well!\n\n### Overall Winner: New Hampshire\nThe overall cheapest state to buy a car in is New Hampshire due to the lack of sales tax and the low registration fees. \n\nFlorida is a close second thanks to a wide variety of used-car inventory and because used cars can cost almost 10 percent less than the national average. Just remember: there is still a 6 percent sales tax on car purchases and much larger registration and title fees.",

It’s been around for over a decade now and has outlasted all of the other boxy hatchbacks that it once rivaled. \n\nThough the styling is still instantly recognizable on this 2020 model, the car has been updated in several crucial ways.\n\nOutside the Soul, its signature style got an overhaul for the new generation. Fans of the original shape will be pleased by its boxy-but-attractive shape, though the new car has decidedly more aggressive angles than the models that preceded it. Kia also updated the car’s exterior lighting fixtures with a narrower shape up front and a unique taillight design that wraps around the rear window. \n\nInside, the Soul no longer has the light-up speakers that became a hallmark of the partying hamster commercials in the car’s early days. Now, we see what Kia calls “Mood Lighting,” where interior lighting can be adjusted to one of six different settings with names like “Hey! Yo!” and “Midnight City.” \n\n![14779 2020 Soul GT-Line](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/41wi2vGiKbdemvMlLtkOBH/ab83336952d6570e8a1d942d821ed9aa/14779_2020_Soul_GT-Line.jpg) \n\n\nThe Soul is available in six trims: LX, S, GT-Line, X-Line, EX, and GT-Line Turbo. All but the GT-Line Turbo model come with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that has 147 horsepower and 132 pound-feet of torque. \n\nThis engine is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and front-wheel-drive (the S trim gets a six-speed manual as standard equipment, with an optional automatic transmission upgrade). \n\nThe GT-Line Turbo gets a smaller turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that has 201 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque. This engine is mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. The Turbo also gets a sport-tuned suspension system.\n\nThe top EX and GT-Line trims also come with a 10.25-inch touchscreen that has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay capability. The entry-level LX trim misses out on features like blind-spot monitors and forward-collision warnings, but stepping up one level to the S trim adds those features, as well as a driver attention warning.\n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n\n## What’s good?\n\n*TLDR: Almost endless practicality and a fun driving experience in a unique package.*\n\n__Practicality:__ The 2020 Soul’s shape isn’t just funky and unique, it also gives the car a lot of practicality and usability. There’s a reason big trucks are square: their shape gives them the ability to stack and shove things into every corner. The same concept applies to the Soul. Inside, there’s headroom for days, and the cargo area is large enough to carry plenty of gear for the entire family.\n\n\n![14757 2020 Soul GT-Line](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2m2hHMqIkndx2CATboHbah/fa27cdba86ad2a1cc6b317a90d78eb4d/14757_2020_Soul_GT-Line.jpg) \n\n\n\n __Fun:__ This might sound surprising, but the new Soul is actually fun to drive, especially in the top GT-Line Turbo trim. Here, the dual-clutch gearbox pairs well with the turbo engine to deliver an engaging and lively driving experience. Even with the base 2.0-liter engine and CVT, the transmission and engine play well together to optimize the available power and keep things moving.\n\n__Style:__ There are polarizing vehicles and then there’s the Kia Soul. Love it or hate it, there is no denying that the Soul stands out in a world of increasingly smoothed-out crossovers and SUVs. The updated appearance leans into the polarizing philosophy with its futuristic headlight design and wrap-around taillights. \n\n---\n\n## What’s bad\n*TLDR: Interior isn’t as comfy in lower trims, advanced safety tech locked away to higher trims.*\n\n__Interior Comfort:__ We can’t fault every company that uses hard plastics and slacks on seat padding in sub-$20,000 vehicles, but it’s more noticeable here. In lower trims, the cloth seats feel under-padded and flat, but the problem is helped a bit with leatherette in higher trim levels.\n\n![14986 2020 Soul X-Line](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/19okrX94OwtMOUjkwYrMA8/03fa08d03d3c770b08f4548e27ff5c74/14986_2020_Soul_X-Line.jpg) \n\n\n\n__Safety Tech Missing:__ In a world where Toyota and Honda have started adding their advanced driver assistance systems to even entry-level vehicles, it feels like the Soul is left behind. The lowest S trim doesn’t get any advanced features, and the list of tech only grows incrementally as buyers step up through the Soul catalog. \n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n## 5 stars of execution\n\nSafety Features? __YES__\n- Despite the lack of advanced features on the base trim, Kia gave the Soul a long enough list of features in most trims to get a ‘Yes’ here.\n- Starting with the S trim level, the Soul comes with lane-change assist, forward-collision avoidance, a driver attention warning system, blind-spot monitors, lane-keep assist, and rear cross-traffic alerts/avoidance. \n- Higher trims get radar cruise control, a head-up display, and forward collision avoidance with pedestrian detection.\n- With those features, the 2019 Soul earned a Top Safety Pick rating from the IIHS. Though the 2020 model has not been rated, it’s reasonable to expect a similar result.\n\nValue? __YES__\n- Most buyers can do without the highest-level features and stronger engine in the GT-Line Turbo model. As a result, the Soul packs a long list of useful features into an affordable package.\n- Even loaded, the GT-Line Turbo tops out under $30,000 and comes with plenty of safety features, great entertainment technology, heated seats, a sunroof, and a wealth of usable space.\n\n\nEfficiency? __YES__\n\n- The EPA rates the Soul with CVT at 27/33/30 MPG city/highway/combined and the Turbo model at 27/32/29 MPG. \n- These fuel economy numbers are good enough to be competitive with the rest of the segment\n- Shoppers looking to prioritize a green Soul should look at the Soul Electric, which offers a 114 MPGe rating from the EPA and a certified 243 miles of electric range, competitive numbers against the Chevrolet Bolt, Hyundai Kona EV and Nissan Leaf Plus. \n\n\nDriving experience? __YES__ \n\n- The Soul stands out against rival appliances like the Toyota CH-R, offering an engaging and lively driving experience.\n- Unfortunately, we also noticed too much road and tire noise when the vehicle is at highway speeds. This is the biggest complaint with the Soul but detracts only slightly from what is otherwise a solid package.\n\n\n\n![14984 2020 Soul X-Line](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2pYYC4kWd9kswR6qr9Mj69/202d92bfce20e04c2710eaa75a8b0643/14984_2020_Soul_X-Line.jpg)\n\n\nExecution? __YES__\n\n- Years ago, Kia made a stand with the Soul, digging in when several of its competitors took their boxy models off the market (looking at you, Scion xB and Honda Element). The result is a surprisingly refined vehicle that retains its original personality and heaps of practicality.\n- Kia’s technology experience is top-notch, as its UVO infotainment system is one of the best.\n- We have to look very closely to find faults in the Soul’s packaging. \n- The vehicle touches nearly every high point that buyers in the segment expect and does so at a reasonable price.\n\n\n## Total Rating: 5 stars\n\n\n\n--- \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\n\nThe base __LX__ trim starts at $18,535 (including destination) and comes with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, six-speed manual transmission, 16-inch wheels, automatic headlights, manual seat adjustments, folding rear seats, a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment display, a six-speaker audio system, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto capabilities, Bluetooth, cruise control, power windows, and door locks, and a backup camera.\n\nThe __LX__ with __CVT__ transmission starts at $20,035 after destination charges.\n\nThe Soul __S__ starts at $21,335 after destination and adds 16-inch alloy wheels, blind-spot monitors, driver attention warnings, forward collision avoidance, lane change assist, lane keep assist, premium cloth upholstery, and rear cross-traffic alerts.\n\nThe Soul __GT-Line__ also starts at $21,335 and includes 18-inch wheels, fog lights, a GT-Line appearance package, a sport steering wheel, dual USB ports in the center console.\n\n![14729 2020 Soul GT-Line](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3FTG8cWXt7bMLpTBPQPYu9/995284bd16298270caa343b0c365551a/14729_2020_Soul_GT-Line.jpg)\n\nThe S trim’s safety features are optional for the GT-Line, as is a power sunroof.\n\nThe Kia Soul __X-Line__ starts at $22,535 after destination and adds an X-Line body kit, and roof rails.\n\nThe Soul __EX__ has a starting price of $23,735 after destination and adds 17-inch wheels, an optional designer package that includes larger wheels and an appearance upgrade, power seats, a 12-volt outlet in the cargo area, automatic climate controls, a cargo cover, heated front seats, and a smart key system with push-button start.\n\nThe Soul __GT-Line Turbo__ starts at $28,535 after destination, and includes all GT-Line features plus the more powerful drivetrain, 18-inch wheels, a power sunroof, LED headlights, LED taillights, mirror-mounted LED turn signals, forward-collision warnings with pedestrian detection, a Harman Kardon sound system, a head-up display, a heated steering wheel, LED interior lighting, leatherette and cloth upholstery with red stitching, and adaptive cruise control.\n\nIf we were shopping for a Soul, we’d pick the __X-Line__ for its additional utility features like roof rails. It also gets a host of safety features and retains a reasonable price tag. The base engine has enough power for most people and the continuously variable transmission isn’t bad at all. The base model is “too basic,” and top trims may be too expensive for some buyers.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Also consider\nThe subcompact and compact crossover market is incredibly popular right now, as many buyers move away from cars into utility vehicles. \n\nThe __Toyota CH-R__ isn’t all that new anymore, but buyers may be tempted with the updated 2019 model that gets standard Apple CarPlay and a larger 8-inch infotainment screen. The Toyota also sports an excellent reliability rating and solid handling.\n\nThe __Honda HR-V__ wins the cargo space battle in the segment but falls short on standard features. Its powertrain, while reliable, is underpowered, and many reviewers note a lack of front-seat comfort. It does, however, offer optional all-wheel-drive.\n\nWe’d avoid the __Ford EcoSport__ for this model year. The powertrains can be noisy and sluggish, and ride quality is below the rest of the segment. \n\nThe __Subaru Crosstrek__ is a strong competitor with tons of cargo space and a well-built interior. It can also be equipped with Subaru’s excellent Eyesight safety features.\n\nHonorable mentions go to the __Nissan Kicks__ and __Chevrolet Trax__. We’ll also see a new entry from __Hyundai__ called the __Venue__ in the near future.\n\n",

      "body": "### Jeep Grand Cherokee Generation Summary  \n\nThe first Jeep Grand Cherokee debuted at the 1992 North American Auto Show when Chrysler president Robert Lutz drove it through a plate of glass at Detroit's Cobo Hall to show off its capability. Though merely a marketing ploy, this action would prove indicative of the Grand Cherokee's attitude and development through the coming years.  \n\nIt was initially designed as a replacement for the regular Jeep Cherokee but ended up being more of a substitute for the Grand Wagoneer that was discontinued in 1991, and Cherokee sales justified its own continued existence. American Motors was developing the basis for the eventual Grand Cherokee before Chrysler bought Jeep from them in 1987. It was the first Jeep product launched under Chrysler, as well as the first Jeep to use computer-aided design software, ensuring engineering efficiency and consistency.   \n\n### 2011 - Present Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2 4th Generation)\n\n[![jeep-grand-cherokee-4th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/68L0azGhpt3ZY6lsKYNfw4/c0c22d615ae434eaeca149823b29d12b/jeep-grand-cherokee-4th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/jeep-grand+cherokee#year_min=2011&year_max)\n\n2011 marked the most recent generational change for the Grand Cherokee with thoroughly modern styling updates, improved technology, further refinement, and several new engine options. It shares its platform with the closely-related Dodge Durango. The new 290 horsepower 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 and 360 horsepower 5.7-liter Hemi V8 both came standard with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel-drive remains standard while four-wheel-drive options come with Quadra-Trac I, Quadra-Trac II, or Quadra-Drive II drive systems through today.   \n\nUpdated features included available ventilated seats, HID headlights, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, four-wheel independent suspension, and air suspension. The Grand Cherokee SRT8 returned for 2012, featuring a 6.4-liter V8 engine that produced 470 horsepower. The new Trailhawk trim was introduced in 2017 as an off-road-focused version of the Grand Cherokee with added ruggedness, additional off-road features, and larger tires.   \n\n2014 saw a mid-cycle refresh with models receiving extensive updates, including a new 8-speed automatic transmission and several styling revisions. The Grand Cherokee SRT8 was renamed the SRT. A new edition to the Grand Cherokee lineup came in 2018 with the Grand Cherokee Trackhawk. It features the 6.2-liter supercharged V8 from the Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat and produces 707 horsepower, making it the most powerful SUV currently on sale.    \n\n[View 4th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/jeep-grand+cherokee#year_min=2011&year_max)\n\n### 2005 - 2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK 3rd Generation)\n\n[![jeep-grand-cherokee-3rd-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5O7vlC4L2O2Mx2raP1x1OH/b5d86dfa2f287dd33a3cb00a3752afdf/jeep-grand-cherokee-3rd-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/jeep-grand+cherokee#year_min=2005&year_max=2010)\n\n2005 saw another complete redesign of the Grand Cherokee, known internally as the WK. The 4.0-liter, six-cylinder engine was replaced with a 3.7-liter V6 engine, producing 210 horsepower. The 4.7-liter V8 carried over from the previous generation, making 230 horsepower, while a new 5.7-liter Hemi V8 was added to the lineup and produced 325 horsepower. A 5-speed automatic transmission came standard with rear-wheel-drive. Four-wheel-drive was optional with the newly available Quadra-Drive II four-wheel-drive system.  \n\nThe WK's front fascia was flatted, and its overall design returned to the original Grand Cherokee's boxy styling roots. Independent suspension and rack-and-pinion steering were firsts for the Grand Cherokee. Options included an infotainment system, side curtain airbags, and navigation, with remote start and a backup camera becoming available several years after its release. Side curtain airbags became standard in 2007 with a slight styling refresh coming shortly after that in 2008.  \n\nSeveral mid-cycle powertrain changes came between 2006 and 2009. The Grand Cherokee SRT8 was added to the lineup in 2006, featuring a 6.1-liter V8 engine that produced 425 horsepower. A 3.0-liter turbodiesel V6 engine, producing 210 horsepower, was offered in 2007. 2008 came with a new 4.7-liter V8, producing 305 horsepower, and 2009 welcomed efficiency improvements and a power bump to 357 horsepower for the 5.7-liter Hemi V8. Both the turbodiesel V6 and 4.7-liter V8 were dropped for 2010.  \n\n[View 3rd Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/jeep-grand+cherokee#year_min=2005&year_max=2010)\n\n### 1999 - 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee (WJ 2nd Generation)\n\n[![jeep-grand-cherokee-2nd-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4KOkkTc6I2zsuSGGgpEReK/9dae4fe25df64470b01b5d223a4f38a8/jeep-grand-cherokee-2nd-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/jeep-grand+cherokee#year_min=1999&year_max=2004)\n\nThe WJ Jeep Grand Cherokee was completely redesigned for the 1999 model year. Its previous boxy shape became rounded and sleek. It grew from the previous generation, and a new 4.7-liter V8 engine, producing 235 horsepower, replaced the 5.2-liter V8 from the ZJ. The 4.0-liter straight six remained the standard engine, though power was increased to 195 horsepower. A redesigned 4-speed automatic transmission remained standard. A new Quadra-Drive four-wheel-drive system featured progressive locking differentials, though rear-wheel drive remained standard.   \n\nOther updates to the WJ included a CD player, more passenger space, interior revisions, and side-curtain airbags. The top-of-the-line Overland trim featured a more powerful high-output V8 engine, which produced 265 horsepower, and became available halfway through the WJ's production run in 2002. A minor styling facelift came in 2003.  \n\n2004 was the final year of WJ production and included several more minor styling updates as well as several special edition models, including the Columbia and Rocky Mountain Editions.  \n\n[View 2nd Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/jeep-grand+cherokee#year_min=1999&year_max=2004)\n\n### 1993 - 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ 1st Generation)\n\n[![jeep-grand-cherokee-1st-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4CRKY6d7aNCQimkAVdQLV4/8a596c3038fe3c88c12dfb9e6c5a67d9/jeep-grand-cherokee-1st-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/jeep-grand+cherokee#year_min=1993&year_max=1998)\n\nThe ZJ was first offered as a 1993 model. It was built on a monocoque frame, provided luxury touches such as power windows, keyless entry, and four-wheel ABS, and was set to compete directly with the Ford Explorer. Three trims were initially available: Base (later changed to SE), Laredo, and Limited, though the SE trim was dropped after only a few years.   \n\nA 5-speed manual transmission was standard with an optional 4-speed automatic transmission. In 1995, the manual transmission was discontinued due to low consumer demand, and the 4-speed automatic became standard. The very first Grand Cherokees were only available with AMC's 4.0-liter straight-six engine, producing 190 horsepower. Shortly after its debut, an optional 5.2-liter V8, producing 220 horsepower, became available. For its last production year in 1998, the first-generation Grand Cherokee Limited received a larger 5.9-liter V8 engine option producing 245 horsepower.  \n\nMinimal additions accompanied the ZJ Grand Cherokee through its infancy, though small improvements such as four-wheel disc brakes, the addition of a passenger-side air bag, ride quality improvements, and several appearance packages were offered throughout its first run.\n\n[View 1st Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/jeep-grand+cherokee#year_min=1993&year_max=1998)",

      "body": "Autolist rating: __4/5__\nBut would we buy it? __Yep!__\nPrice range: __$37,045 to $66,440__, including destination but before options.\n\n## Key takeaways\n\n- The S60 was totally redesigned for 2019.\n- There’s a variety of solid turbocharged powertrain options for the model line.\n- The spacious interior and generous rear seats come at the expense of a small trunk.\n- The T8 and Polestar models make a whopping 400 and 415 hp, respectively.\n- Most models have sporty handling that doesn’t ruin the smooth ride.\n\n---\n\n![239369 New Volvo S60 Polestar Engineered exterior](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/34Ar26H2v3ikFTwG6NBLw6/ba58aa7860bddb8c923eef5d70f73599/239369_New_Volvo_S60_Polestar_Engineered_exterior.jpg) \n\n\n## What is it?\n\nThe Volvo S60 is a compact premium sedan that slots into the automaker’s lineup below the larger S90.\n\nThe S60 -- and its wagon counterpart, the V60 -- were completely redesigned for the 2019 model year with a new exterior design, updated tech and safety features, and premium materials throughout. \n\nVolvo’s trim and model structure is a bit different than other companies’ lineups, and is separated into trims that are then further broken down by drivetrain choice. There are four primary trim levels: Momentum, Inscription, R-Design, and T8 Polestar Engineered. \n\nBeyond that, there is the T5 front-wheel drive that has a four-cylinder engine with 250 hp, a T6 all-wheel drive that has 316 hp, a T8 eAWD plug-in hybrid that makes 400 hp, and the T8 eAWD Polestar that has 415 hp. T8 powertrains come with both a supercharger and a turbocharger to produce their power. Because they're supercharged, power delivery is smoother.\n\nThe S60 is aimed at new car buyers that want a luxury experience but don’t need a ton of space. Volvo is also popular for its safety technologies, which are plentiful across the S60 lineup. \n\nThe car competes with other premium sedans like the BMW 3-Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Jaguar XE, Lexus IS, Acura TLX, Genesis G70, Infiniti Q50, and Audi A3/A4. \n\nWhile it's similarly priced, the Swedish sedan is quirkier and has a unique look that sets it apart from the others. There's also a wagon version of the car, known as the Volvo V60, with similar trims and options to the S60 Sedan.\n\n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n## What’s good\n\n*TLDR: Sporty powertrain options, luxurious and spacious interior, solid technology features.*\n\n__Powertrains:__ With up to 415 horsepower on tap, the S60 can be configured to be downright fast. It’s got all the chops of a legitimate sports sedan, but carries itself much more as a luxury car. Optional all-wheel drive is a bonus for people that live in cold weather climates. \n\n\n![239381 New Volvo S60 Polestar Engineered interior](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6bQFiixcpdi3fx1Jz2LzOC/1bc3777a852e40182f4cd4611f6f158e/239381_New_Volvo_S60_Polestar_Engineered_interior.jpg) \n\n__Interior:__ The S60 is a compact car that doesn’t look like it has any business sporting a legitimate amount of head and leg room, but that’s what we get from Volvo’s smallest sedan. The cabin is appointed with high-end materials that feel more expensive than they are, and the whole package is designed cleanly in Volvo’s quirky Scandinavian style.\n\n__Technology:__ The S60 comes packed with driver assistance features like lane keep assist, and plenty of options like adaptive cruise control. The new S60 comes with a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, and there’s standard Apple CarPlay/Android Auto. The touchscreen infotainment system, while feature-rich, can be frustrating to use.\n\n---\n\n## What’s bad\n\n*TLDR: Handling doesn’t match powertrains, the trunk is tiny, and infotainment can be hard to use.*\n\n__Tiny Trunk:__ It’s obvious that Volvo prioritized people space over cargo space in the S60, and while that’s not necessarily a bad thing, loading up something like a large suitcase  can be a frustrating experience. \n\n__Frustrating Infotainment:__ Despite the abundance of features and tech, the Sensus infotainment system can be confusing and frustrating to operate. At least the tablet-style screen is bright, colorful, and easy to read. \n\n__Handling:__ In lower trims, the S60 doesn’t feel as agile or sporty as it does in higher trims. Though there’s plenty of power from the 250-hp T5 powertrain, there’s more body roll and the ride feels less planted than we’d like.\n\n\n![239377 New Volvo S60 Polestar Engineered exterior](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2a2jrtd0KvICimPku3Xsgd/2724b88c6f8e666688c13a60c941dfdd/239377_New_Volvo_S60_Polestar_Engineered_exterior.jpg) \n\n---\n\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n## 5 stars of execution\n\nSafety Features? __YES__\n- Volvos have long been known known for their safety features and the S60 doesn't disappoint. Even the base model comes standard with collision mitigation support, a lane keeping system, hill start assist, and a park assist camera.\n\n- Optional features include a 360-degree camera, a driver assistance system with adaptive cruise control, a head-up display, full LED lighting, and more.\n\n- The 2019 S60 received “Good” scores in all categories except headlights, where it scored a “Marginal”. Front crash prevention was rated “Superior” with standard tech in place.\n\nValue? __NO__\n- The S60 is expensive, starting at over $36,000, and for that money all safety tech should be standard. \n\n- Options packages are expensive and can easily add thousands to the S60’s bottom line. Higher trims get luxury features like heated front seats, but buyers will pay for the privilege.\n\n- Black is the only “no-cost” option. Every other color adds $645 to the price tag.\n\n![239393 New Volvo S60 R-Design exterior](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/KpggIUEJ7cOWk4mFLy4md/b7f2d0862ddbc8119d71d4e703832482/239393_New_Volvo_S60_R-Design_exterior.jpg) \n\n\nEfficiency? __YES__\n- The base front-wheel drive S60 hits fuel economy numbers of 34 mpg highway, which is competitive with the BMW 3-Series and Audi A4.\n\n- Plug-in hybrid models reach 31 mpg combined while delivering serious performance and the all-wheel drive T6 still does decently at 25 mpg combined.\n\nDriving experience? __Yes__ \n- Despite some handling missteps in lower trims, the S60 has an engaging driving experience and plenty of power. \n\n- Higher trims, especially the Polestar model, have direct steering, more than generous power, and confidence-inspiring handling. \n\n- The cabin remains quiet and relaxing, and the S60’s suspension soaks up all but the worst road imperfections.\n\nExecution? __YES__\n\n- There could be more standard features and fewer added charges for things like color choices, but the S60 offers a premium experience that mostly matches up with its price tag.\n\n- Interior materials are quality and feel expensive, while the exterior styling and stance are befitting of a premium sedan.\n\n- The Volvo stands up well to more popular rivals like the BMW 3-Series and Audi A4, and offers a slightly different experience for people that want to be unique.\n\n## Total Rating:  4 stars\n\n--- \n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\n\nThe base Volvo S60 T5 Momentum FWD starts at $37,045 after a $995 destination charge, and comes with a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel, a high-performance audio system, USB connections, Bluetooth, navigation, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, Sirius Satellite Radio and HD Radio,, dual exhausts, selectable drive modes, LED headlights, dual-zone climate control, 18-inch wheels, a panoramic moonroof, leatherette seats, lane-keeping aids, hill-start assist, and a rain-sensing system.\n\nThe Momentum T6 AWD starts at $41,545 after destination and adds the aforementioned all-wheel-drive plus the 316-horsepower engine\n\nThe S60 R-Design T5 starts at $44,540 after destination, and comes with Nappa leather, metal mesh inlays, a Harman Kardon premium sound system, a power trunk , illuminated door handles, fog lights, four-zone climate controls, sport seat padding, memory front seats, and blind spot monitors with cross-traffic alerts. This trim level also adds various (and minor) upgrades inside and outside the S60 to give it a sportier look, plus a lower, stiffer suspension for better handling.\n\n![239392 New Volvo S60 R-Design exterior](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4XdjaJj7cEujffLWNMFrAS/7d442ac532e9500820d7b84b61641653/239392_New_Volvo_S60_R-Design_exterior.jpg)\n\nThe R-Design T6 AWD has a starting price of $49,040 after destination.\n\nThe R-Design T8 eAWD Plug-in Hybrid has a starting price of $57,040 after destination.\n\nThe S60 Inscription T5 has a starting price of $44,540 after destination and has similar options to the R-Design, with the exception of comfort seats.\n\nThe Inscription T6 AWD has a starting price of $49,040 after destination charges.\n\nThe Inscription T8 eAWD Plug-In Hybrid has a starting price of $57,040 after destination.\n\nThe S60 Polestar Engineered T8 eAWD Plug-in Hybrid has a starting price of $66,440 after destination, and comes with a graphical head-up display, a Bowers & Wilkins premium sound system, electric rear axle drive, Polestar chassis tuning, full LED active bending headlights, a high-pressure headlight cleaning system, 19-inch wheels, dual-zone climate controls, a heated steering wheel, adaptive cruise control, a 360-degree camera, and pilot assist with navigation.\n\nIf we were shopping for an S60, we’d pick the Momentum T6 with all-wheel drive and add a few options packages for a complete luxury experience that costs less than most of the other trims. \n\n![239385 New Volvo S60 R-Design exterior](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/14MghSBAsUjQTmdnu1yWpD/f8257505a37b1ba9500548ff1031e367/239385_New_Volvo_S60_R-Design_exterior.jpg) \n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n## Also consider\n\nThe Audi A4 is one of the best handling and most comfortable entry-level luxury sedans on the market. Its interior feels as spacious as the Volvo’s does, and there’s plenty of tech on board. Its great handling and driving dynamics don’t come at the expense of ride quality, however, as it retains a comfortable ride over a variety of surfaces.\n\nThe BMW 3-Series was redesigned for 2019 with a larger size, better handling, and more tech options than the models that preceded it. The new car corrects many of the sloppy characteristics of the previous generation and retains the BMW driving experience we all expect.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C300 is a benchmark in the luxury segment, and remains one of the best offerings on the market. The 2019 models got a new engine and several other changes, but it remains a refined and luxurious car that matches up well against all competitors.\n\nThe Genesis G70 has excellent road manners (plus the availability of a manual transmission), sublime build quality and luxury amenities, and a smart price point. It’s worth a look for car shoppers who don’t mind that it’s not from a more traditional luxury brand (Genesis is the luxury division of Hyundai). \n\n\n\n",

      "body": "Autolist rating: __5/5__\nBut would we buy it? __Definitely__\nPrice range: __$24,330 - $34,230__, including destination but before options\n\n## Key takeaways\n- Completely redesigned for the 2020 model year, the Sonata does everything well.\n- Offers a base four-cylinder engine or an optional turbo with curiously less power.\n- Crisp and bold styling reminiscent of earlier generation Sonata. \n- Should be at the top of your midsize sedan shopping list.\n\n---\n\n![Large-39696-2020SonataLimited](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/qAjMU6utDZgAWS2jSEwQZ/661a710e6d822cea537fdc39aa7fd583/Large-39696-2020SonataLimited.jpg)\n\n## What is it?\n\nThe Sonata is a midsize sedan from Hyundai. It’s a competitor in the shrinking segment of family sedans that includes the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima, Volkswagen Passat, Kia Optima, Mazda6, and the soon-to-be-discontinued Ford Fusion and Chevrolet Malibu. \n\nWithin Hyundai’s lineup, the Sonata is larger than the compact Elantra, and the subcompact Accent, the compact Veloster, and the trio of Ioniq hatchbacks (EV, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid). \n\nThis 2020 model is an all-new generation that’s been redesigned from the ground up. It’s 1.2 inches lower than the outgoing model, plus 1.8-inches longer overall, one inch wider, and it now has a wheelbase that’s been stretched 1.4-inches. \n\nThere are currently two powertrains available across four trim levels. \n\nThe base SE and mid-level SEL trims come with a naturally-aspirated 2.5-liter, four-cylinder engine that makes 191 horsepower and 181 pound-feet of torque. It’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe rest of the lineup in the Sonata family consists of the SEL Plus and the Limited. These versions come with a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that makes 180 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque. It’s also front-wheel-drive only and also comes with an eight-speed automatic transmission. \n\nLate next year (2020), Hyundai will introduce the Sonata N-Line. This performance-oriented model will serve as a more powerful answer to higher-output turbo engines and V6 variants of rivals like the Accord, Camry, and Altima. It will have a 2.5-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder engine and an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission with paddle shifters. \n\nThis N-Line model will have about 290 horsepower and 310 pound-feet of torque, plus a variety of upgrades including a retuned and lowered suspension, larger brakes, and various cosmetic upgrades to the interior and exterior. \n\n![Large-38749-2020HyundaiSonata](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1VYGjPImFb3jbdMLuwiNjL/73a8e1b0f67fd23590e04f162f745776/Large-38749-2020HyundaiSonata.jpg)\n\nA Sonata Hybrid is expected to go on sale in 2020 and should pack a solar roof that will generate an additional 800 miles of power each year, provided it gets six hours of sunlight a day. \n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n## What’s good?\n*TLDR: Stylish, spacious, savvy.*\n\n__Stand-out styling:__ One look at the Sonata and it’s clear Hyundai isn’t ready to call it quits on the midsize sedan segment, despite the growing popularity of crossovers and SUVs. This is a car that stands out in a crowd for all the right reasons. Its styling is unique but disciplined, it’s not trying too hard to be flashing or different. \n\nIt also looks more expensive than it is, a key feature of the stylish Sonata that vaulted Hyundai into mainstream consideration back in 2010. One particularly neat trick: the LED daytime lights are hidden beneath a strip of chrome trim; when the lights are on, they look like lights but when they're off, the piece seamlessly blends into the chrome. \n\n__Space everywhere:__ It’s in the trunk, it’s in the rear seats, it’s in the front seats. Everywhere you look, Hyundai has packed the Sonata with heaps of space. Tall people can sit in the back with plenty of leg and head room, even if they’re sitting behind someone equally lengthy. Despite its sleek exterior proportions, Hyundai worked hard to make the inside of this Sonata spacious. \n\n![Large-36041-2020HyundaiSonata](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1jPoMCb4MOhRp2ugxq0zgW/a10d638083492c23bc0de319d03340b4/Large-36041-2020HyundaiSonata.jpg)\n\n__Strong value:__ Whether you choose the base SE or a loaded Limited, the Sonata offers a strong value. Each trim is competitively equipped with plenty of standard tech, safety, and styling goodies. Even better? The base SE model doesn’t actually look like it’s the cheapest choice. We like that.\n\n\n## What’s bad\n*TLDR: Noisy at speed, firm ride, optional engine needs more power.*\n\n__Road noise:__ We spent half our testing in an SEL Plus model and found a little too much road noise kicked up by the tires themselves. The rest of the Sonata’s ride experience was perfectly quiet and pleasant, but the tires on this particular trim were just a little too loud. It’s certainly not a dealbreaker for the Sonata but make sure you take it on your local highway when you test drive to make sure the sound levels meet your expectations. \n\n__Down on power:__ In our testing of the SEL Plus and the Limited models (no base engine cars were available), we found the 180-horsepower turbo four to be reasonably good in most situations but also a smidge underpowered. Its output pales in comparison to the optional engines on a variety of the Sonata’s competitors (like the Camry with its optional V6 or the Accord with its optional 2.0-liter turbo engine), forthcoming Sonata N-Line notwithstanding. \n\n__Firm ride:__ This is a minor quibble but something to pay attention to if you’re test driving the new Sonata. The SEL Plus model we tested had a firm ride; depending on your preference for firmness it might even register as TOO firm, especially as you drive over potholes and bumps in the road. This (again, minor) issue didn’t seem as pervasive on Limited model we also tested.\n\n![Large-35791-HyundaiMotorSharesFirstGlimpseofAll-NewSonata](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/xopp8D0rDfr5BTLkgeLg2/0ecfb2c2075ccae6de1bf46baa75a2df/Large-35791-HyundaiMotorSharesFirstGlimpseofAll-NewSonata.jpg)\n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n## 5 stars of execution\n\nSafety Features? __YES__\n- All Sonatas come standard with active safety features like pre-collision braking (automatic emergency braking), adaptive cruise control with integrated stop-and-go feature, and lane-follow assist (keeps the car centered in your lane). \n- This Sonata hasn’t yet been crash-tested by NHTSA or IIHS yet though it’s likely that the car will get a five-star crash rating from NHTSA and models with optional headlights will get a Top Safety Pick Plus designation from IIHS. \n\nValue? __YES__\n-   As we mentioned, ever trim level of the Sonata packs an impressive value for the money. \n-  This applies to the base SE, which starts at $24,330, all the way up to the loaded Limited, which can top out at $34,230. \n\nEfficiency? __YES__\n-    The base Sonata is rated at 27/37/31 MPG city/highway/combined. \n- The models that we tested -- with the optional 1.6-liter turbo four -- are rated at 27/36/31 MPG city/highway/combined. \n- Those figures put it in line with some of the most efficient (non-hybrid) models in its segment. \n- A Sonata hybrid model is also due out soon for Sonata fans who are really looking to save gas. Its fuel economy rating have yet to be released.\n\nDriving experience? __YES__\n- For a midsize family sedan in this segment, the Sonata is an entirely comfortable and competent sedan to drive.\n- The steering is much improved from earlier Hyundai models, the car itself is responsive and handles well, and despite some turbo lag, the optional turbo engine has enough power to suit drivers’ needs. \n- The Sonata’s handling isn’t as crisp as the Accord or Mazda6 -- segment leaders in that department -- but for a pleasing daily driver, the Sonata should make buyers of all stripes happy. \n\n![Large-36019-2020HyundaiSonata](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3arHGld52DLCHvAtCcyfXG/5d390956e08417e8f7eb0ac805f5c82e/Large-36019-2020HyundaiSonata.jpg)\n\nExecution? __YES__\n-    Hyundai clearly did its homework with this Sonata and it made great strides in not only addressing the flaws of its predecessor but also the wants and needs of people buying these family sedans. \n-    This new model is stylish, practical, desirable, safe, and affordable, a far cry from the technically fine but emotionless and clinical Sonata that it replaces. \n-    Overall, this Sonata should be on the shopping list of anyone considering a sedan at the moment. \n\n\n##  Total Rating:  5 stars\n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\n\nAs mentioned, the base 2020 __Sonata SE__ starts at $24,330, including destination. \n\nThat model comes with the 191-horsepower, four-cylinder engine, eight-speed automatic transmission, 16-inch alloy wheels, the suite of active safety tech (automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane-keep assist, lane-follow assist, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go ability), LED daytime lights, headlights, and taillights, eight-inch color touchscreen infotainment system with Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, and backup camera.\n\nThe $26,430 __SEL__ model (destination included) adds items like rear cross-traffic collision assist, an eight-way power driver’s seat, 17-inch alloy wheels, heated front seats, heated side mirrors, and keyless entry and start, blind-spot collision avoidance. \n\nThe $28,380 __SEL Plus__ model adds to the SEL items like the turbocharged, 1.6-liter engine, digital key access using your smartphone, wireless smartphone charging, 18-inch alloy wheels, auto-dimming rear-view mirror, a 12.3-inch color digital instrument panel, faux-leather seats, dual climate control, and paddle shifters. \n\nFinally, the range-topping __Limited__ model starts at $34,230 and comes with the same 1.6-liter turbo engine as the SEL Plus, and adds features like a remote parking feature (for tight spaces, allowing driver to stand outside the car and park it), a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, color heads-up display, blind-spot monitoring that uses side-view cameras to project a view of the side of the car and lane next to you on the digital instrument panel, a 360-degree parking camera, leather seats, power passenger seat, ventilated front seats, 12-speaker Bose audio system, and heated steering wheel.\n\n![Large-38573-2020HyundaiSonata](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3QgH4kRDozH7FcVQ4st55N/f70d5cf29cd991337c5ae71257bc5e05/Large-38573-2020HyundaiSonata.jpg)\n\nIf it were our money, __we’d likely opt for the SEL__. It’s right in the sweet spot of what you need and what you want and there are a trio of option packages you can add to it for a better customization if there are specific features you’re looking to add.  \n\n---\n\n## Also consider:\n\nThis is a ruthlessly competitive segment with some nameplates that are among the best-known (and best-selling) in the industry. While this new Sonata moves to the top of this segment, here’s a look at the other models we would consider. \n\n__Honda’s Accord__ is the most well-rounded model in the segment and while it lacks the Sonata’s style, it makes up for it with near-luxury execution and a more engaging driving experience. \n\n__Mazda’s 6__ is probably the best-looking and the best-driving model in the group so it should definitely be on your shopping list. \n\n__Toyota’s Camry__ is nice and also very well-rounded but we like the execution of the Honda more. \n\n__Kia’s Optima__ is the close cousin of the Sonata but the Optima that’s available currently is based on the older generation of Sonata. As such, it’s getting a little long in the tooth. \n\n__VW’s Passat__ is big and packs impressive levels of European refinement. But it’s boring to drive and look at. \n\n__Ford’s Fusion__ and __Chevy’s Malibu__ are both set to be discontinued in the near future and while the current generations are each getting old, they’ve aged well and might offer a good value. \n\n__Nissan’s Altima__ is also new for 2019 and while we certainly liked it -- particularly the exterior styling and the availability of all-wheel-drive -- we were generally underwhelmed by its overall execution. \n",

A new survey by Autolist.com found that more consumers would prefer an EV pickup from the incumbent brands than the newcomers -- unless they’ve never owned a truck before.\n\nAutolist surveyed roughly 1,100 current car shoppers in late November and early December and asked them which of the four upcoming electric trucks they would prefer: the unnamed General Motors pickup, Ford’s next-gen all-electric F-150, the Tesla Cybertruck, or Rivian’s R1T. \n\nAcross all respondents, GM’s truck was the top choice, grabbing 29 percent of the vote. Ford’s truck followed closely behind, with 27 percent, followed by the Rivian R1T at 24 percent, and Tesla’s Cybertruck, with 20 percent.\n\n![Screen Shot 2019-12-09 at 11.16.32 PM](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1ohNalmLhAQqdX5PUW8yQQ/e6419e8d468e303299cc07d50a863261/Screen_Shot_2019-12-09_at_11.16.32_PM.png)\n\n“Frankly, these results are good for all four brands,” said Chase Disher, analyst at Autolist.com. “It shows that Ford and GM can leverage their considerable -- and existing -- truck followings to boost interest in their EV models. Meanwhile, it shows that Tesla and Rivian could be poised to grab a meaningful share of a [crucial new growth segment](https://www.autolist.com/news-and-analysis/study-midsize-lifestyle-trucks).”\n\nThis quartet of EV trucks is expected to start hitting the road in 2021. Of the four, details on GM’s model remain the thinnest; the automaker has yet to confirm which of its nameplates will carry the EV pickup, and there are persistent rumors that GM will resurrect the Hummer brand as an all-electric nameplate. \n\n![2018 11 R1T 4 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4QIdFt9V3vNceCv8JDSMyx/5b5150da8b3e460f702bb10188f7ede7/2018_11_R1T_4__1_.jpg)\n\n### Grabbing new truck buyers \n\nAutolist also asked respondents whether they currently own or have previously owned a full-size truck, to see if there was any correlation between existing truck ownership and appetite for an EV version. \n\nFifty percent of respondents had never owned a truck; 49 percent had owned a truck, and one percent was unsure. \n\nThe survey found that if people had never owned a truck before, they were more likely to consider the Tesla Cybertruck than if they have owned a truck in their lifetime. \n\nJust 14 percent of people who had owned a truck chose the Cybertruck over the other three models. But just over a quarter of people who had never owned a truck (26 percent) chose the Tesla. \n\nIn fact, among non-truck owners, the Cybertruck was the most popular choice of the four in the survey:\n\n1. Tesla Cybertruck: 25.8 percent\n2. Rivian R1T: 24.8 percent\n3. Ford F-150 Electric: (tie) 24.7 percent\n3. GM Electric truck: (tie) 24.7 percent\n\nHere’s the popularity of the four EV trucks among people who had owned a truck before:\n\n1. GM Electric truck: 35 percent\n2. Ford F-150 Electric: 28 percent\n3. Rivian R1T: 23 percent\n4. Tesla Cybertruck: 14 percent\n\nOne noteworthy result here was the fact that the popularity of the EV trucks from Ford, GM, and Tesla swung considerably, depending on prior truck ownership. Yet interest in the Rivian was nearly the same regardless of whether the consumer had owned a truck before. \n\n“What this tells us is that the upcoming Rivian and Tesla trucks can coexist on the market as newcomers without cannibalizing sales from one another,” Disher said. “The Rivian can appeal to a more traditional truck buyer looking for something fresh, while the Tesla can appeal to those new to the segment looking for a more performance-based model.”\n\nThe significant price difference between the base Cybertruck (priced between $40,000 and $69,900) and the Rivian R1T (which starts at $69,000) should help further differentiate the two.\n\n### Strengths of each model\n\nAutolist also asked each respondent to pick three reasons why they choose that particular truck. \n\nThe top five most-cited reasons for each truck -- and the percentage of respondents who choose each -- are as follows:\n\n__GM EV truck:__ \n\n![2020-Chevrolet-Silverado-Diesel-094 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3PRfEF2R4ys9e158k5Xyb/6525a3b4908e2148829a386a35374213/2020-Chevrolet-Silverado-Diesel-094__1_.jpg)\n\n1. Prefer/trust GM brands more than others (62 percent)\n2. Expected reliability (41 percent)\n3. Expected performance (37 percent)\n4. I currently own or have owned a GM pickup (27 percent)\n5. Expected vehicle size (27 percent)\n\n“This survey indicates that GM -- regardless of which brand they launch their EV truck with -- has the most to gain from awareness and trust in its current products,” Disher said. “This is likely due to the combination of a strong truck portfolio and a longer EV legacy than most incumbent automakers.”\n\n__Ford F-150 Electric:__\n\n![All-Electric-F-150-03 (1) (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3T3d6AKCUTpN8eEQNRQl8f/df46696d9db025867fd40ab895c0c60a/All-Electric-F-150-03__1___1_.jpg)\n\n1. Prefer/trust Ford more than others (54 percent)\n2. Expected reliability (52 percent) \n3. Expected performance (38 percent)\n4. Expected vehicle size (27 percent)\n5. Expected practicality and features (26 percent)\n\n“Like GM, Ford should be able to capitalize on its widespread awareness and trust in the F-150 name,” Disher said. “It’s practically its own brand within Ford, and its immense annual sales volumes should give the upcoming electric version a leg up in terms of overall sales.”\n\n__Tesla Cybertruck:__\n\n![Cybertruck 2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6PEvVHOcFfbO9omY2QneHd/6c274f7470f8a31a786a7e87c55d1733/Cybertruck_2.jpg)\n\n1. Expected performance (50 percent)\n2. Expected efficiency (tie -- 33 percent)\n2. Tesla’s AutoPilot (tie -- 33 percent)\n4. Tesla’s Supercharging network (29 percent)\n5. Expected practicality and features (26 percent)\n\nThe number one reason people choose the Cybertruck was its expected performance, which was not the case for any of the other three rivals.\n\n“This shows us what’s drawing people to the Tesla truck,” Disher said. “It’s not outright practicality, efficiency, towing or hauling capabilities as is generally the case with pickups. Fans of this truck like it for its promised performance first.”\n\nAlso interesting was the lack of “Exterior styling” among the top reasons people choose the wild -- and polarizing -- Tesla Cybertruck. In fact, not a single respondent choose “Exterior styling” as a reason for picking the Tesla over the other three EVs. \n\nIt’s also worth noting that two of Tesla’s best-known entities -- its Supercharging network and its Autopilot hands-free driving system -- were cited in the top five reasons people choose the Cybertruck. The popularity of these features is regularly cited by experts and executives at other automakers as important advantages weighing in Tesla’s favor. \n\nIt’s also a phenomenon Autolist has also observed in two prior surveys that pit a Tesla vehicle against a legacy competitor, be it [Porsche’s Taycan](https://www.autolist.com/news-and-analysis/survey-tesla-model-s-versus-porsche-taycan) or [Ford’s Mach E](https://www.autolist.com/news-and-analysis/survey-tesla-model-y-versus-ford-mustang-mach-e). \n\n__Rivian R1T:__\n\n![2019 11 R1TWhite SA DSTurn Action AEM05347 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/28fNR90ut7w90PXB1L5yRC/dcc2769681cc0ab59b6e540a9f2b483b/2019_11_R1TWhite_SA_DSTurn_Action_AEM05347__1_.jpg)\n\n1. Exterior styling (75 percent)\n2. Expected vehicle size (tie -- 35 percent)\n2. Expected performance  (tie -- 35 percent)\n4. Expected practicality and features (30 percent)\n5. Expected efficiency (21 percent)\n\nRivian’s results were noteworthy because -- unlike the Tesla -- its exterior styling proved to be its biggest draw in Autolist’s survey. It’s also the least well-known brand in this four-way comparison, yet it still topped Tesla’s Cybertruck overall in this poll. \n\n“The Rivian R1T falls on the premium end of the growing lifestyle truck segment and offers a unique mix of aspirational features and everyday practicality,” Disher said. “It’s just different enough so as to attract plenty of well-heeled, outdoor-minded buyers, but unlike the Tesla, the Rivian’s shape and design are familiar enough to make existing truck owners feel comfortable driving one.” \n\n### Popularity by age group\n\nAutolist’s survey found that the popularity of Tesla’s Cybertruck was closely linked to the age of the respondent: the younger the consumer, the more likely they are to choose the Tesla. \n\nIt was the most popular choice by a wide margin among respondents 18 to 28 years old, with Ford’s F-150 Electric ranking second with this age group, Rivian’s R1T coming in third, and GM’s EV truck in fourth. \n\nThe Rivian was the most popular with shoppers 29-35, followed by the GM, the Ford, and the Tesla. Those results repeated themselves for shoppers 46-55 years old. \n\nFor all other age groups, it was the GM electric that was on top, followed by the Ford, with the Tesla Cybertruck on the bottom. \n\n“This is both a blessing and a curse for Tesla,” Disher said. “While any automaker welcomes the enthusiasm of a younger buyer, it’s typically the older, affluent consumer who actually buys more of these high-dollar vehicles.”",

It has become more user-friendly over the years, adding additional creature comforts and luxurious trimmings, but its roots as a go-anywhere utility vehicle are still apparent after a short time behind the wheel. \n\nToyota hasn’t done much to update the Land Cruiser for 2020, but it didn’t need to, as the people who are buying it aren’t after the latest and greatest in tech. Finding even a heavily used Toyota Land Cruiser for sale is difficult to do for a reasonable price, and any that are sitting on dealership lots command top dollar.\n\nThere’s one powertrain option, a 5.7-liter V-8 with 381 horsepower that puts power down through an eight-speed automatic transmission and full-time four-wheel drive. The Land Cruiser's 8,100-pound towing capacity, cavernous cargo area, and unbelievable four-wheel drive abilities make it great for buyers looking for the ultimate SUV.\n\nThe Land Cruiser sits atop Toyota’s SUV lineup, with the Sequoia and 4Runner rounding out the SUV range, and the Highlander, RAV4, HR-V making up the crossover lineup. The Land Cruiser also shares most of its underpinnings and powertrain with the Lexus LX570.\n\n\n---\n\n## What’s good\n\n\n\n*TLDR: The Land Cruiser has legendary reliability, serious off-road abilities, and a luxurious interior.*\n\n\n\n__Reliability:__ There’s a reason why even the oldest Land Cruisers with well over 100,000 miles are still relatively expensive: They just work. Land Cruisers are among the longest-lasting vehicles on the road and are so overbuilt that they can handle nearly anything that comes their way. Take a look at new footage from any remote country with rough terrain, and you'll surely see the Land Cruiser hauling people and equipment where other vehicles can't.\n\n![2020 Toyota Land Cruiser 02 3E98D9200109FC784E01710219DF22F8DC1B6EBB (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1NvN9LfMxsef8DK2feTIQg/9fba7ee480ea5061d67e1fa87e81e752/2020_Toyota_Land_Cruiser_02_3E98D9200109FC784E01710219DF22F8DC1B6EBB__1_.jpg) \n\n\n__Off-Road Ability:__ It’s probably true that even the most enthusiastic Land Cruiser buyer won’t use the vehicle to its fullest ability, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s one of the most capable off-roaders on the market today. Full-time four-wheel drive and the ability to tackle seriously difficult terrain make the Land Cruiser a top pick for anyone wanting a comfortable vehicle with legitimate chops.\n\n\n\n__Interior:__ A step inside the Land Cruiser’s interior and two things become clear: First, the cabin feels every bit like one that would and should come with a vehicle that costs over $85,000. Second, there’s nothing to indicate that underneath you sits one of the world’s most capable off-road vehicles. The seats are supremely comfortable, the styling is clean, materials are high-quality, and construction is top-notch. \n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n## What’s bad\n\n\n\n*TLDR: The Land Cruiser is missing the newest entertainment tech, gets terrible fuel economy, and is absurdly expensive*\n\n__Dated Technology:__ The sky-high price tag buys a JBL stereo, an 8.0-inch touchscreen with navigation, and a boatload of off-road equipment, but it doesn’t include Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. Toyota’s Entune infotainment system is dated and clunky at its best, but at least the stereo sounds great. Toyota also  endowed the Land Cruiser with its latest Toyota Safety Sense equipment, which brings radar cruise control, auto high beams, and more.\n\n\n![2020 Toyota Land Cruiser 05 EC43468C26080FFDF2DDCD8AB7B47D313F6EA725 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1hvUoFBrrz58atILgxPaTt/90c294a5db580ff2284166466d26d707/2020_Toyota_Land_Cruiser_05_EC43468C26080FFDF2DDCD8AB7B47D313F6EA725__1_.jpg) \n\n\n__Terrible Fuel Economy:__ There are no surprises here. The Land Cruiser is a big vehicle with an old-school V-8 under the hood. Add in full-time four-wheel drive, and there’s a recipe for disappointing fuel economy. The big Toyota has a range of almost 450 miles, but that’s because it has a fuel tank that can hold 25 gallons. It burns through all of that fuel at a disastrous rate, hitting 13/18/15 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\n\n\n __Pricey:__ The Land Cruiser is multiple times more expensive than next most costly Toyota vehicle available and even costs thousands more than rivals from Ford, Chevy and Infiniti.  Is it worth it? To some it might be, as an understated luxury vehicle, but many people will have a problem shelling out almost $90,000 for a Toyota. It's almost as expensive as the nearly identical Lexus LX 570.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n## 5 stars of execution\n\n\n\nSafety Features? __YES__\n\n- Toyota recently gave the Land Cruiser a full list of active safety technologies, that include automatic braking, pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitors, and lane departure warnings. There aren’t any automated assistants or lane control, though.\n\n- The Land Cruiser hasn’t been rated by the IIHS or NHTSA.\n\n\nValue? __NO__\n\n- This one’s subjective, but it’s going to be tough for most people to pay over $80,000 for a Toyota, even after considering the fact that it’s a bulletproof and luxurious vehicle.\n\n- Most options and features are included in the price tag, which helps. The only add-on is a $2,200 rear-seat entertainment package that can easily be replaced with a couple of iPads and headphones for the kids.\n\n- The Land Cruiser will last nearly long enough to be handed down to your children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![2019 Toyota Land Cruiser 12 9080799840BDE4E85737F3B1F2857A8047B4421A (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5HvVGOTnvm9QJeKs9BfSrm/a562a60b7f180d83dbfcda9a0b638a37/2019_Toyota_Land_Cruiser_12_9080799840BDE4E85737F3B1F2857A8047B4421A__1_.jpg) \n\n\n\nEfficiency? __NO__\n- Low double-digit city fuel economy and a big V-8 mean there will be frequent stops at the gas station, helped only by the huge gas tank.\n \n- The Land Cruiser is rated at 13/18/15 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\n- Those numbers make the Land Cruiser one of the thirstiest vehicles on the road today.\n\nDriving experience? __YES__ \n\n- On the road, the Land Cruiser feels as big as it looks and lumbers along without much care for handling, but at least it’s quiet, comfortable, and serene. \n\n- Off-road driving is where the magic happens.The Land Cruiser is far more capable than almost any other vehicle and makes tough trails look easy. \n\n- Off-road abilities don't come at the expense of on-road comfort and refinement for the Land Cruiser, as it remains a good vehicle for everyday family-hauling.\n\nExecution? __YES__\n\n- The Land Cruiser feels like a tank because it is. There’s not much else like it on the market and almost nothing can beat its build quality. The large size also means great people and cargo space.\n\n- Despite its size and age, the Land Cruiser is a handsome and clean-looking SUV.\n\n- Great reliability scores will keep it on the road for a long time, meaning the Land Cruiser could be a vehicle you pass down to your children.\n\n![2020 Toyota Land Cruiser 09 E06F022A865A86E9377D672BC29E6954D861C37B (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3rfg1nRQ6rskqeT2ow3kad/178530b5c585000e99835ce77fcdb343/2020_Toyota_Land_Cruiser_09_E06F022A865A86E9377D672BC29E6954D861C37B__1_.jpg) \n\n\n## Total Rating:  3 stars\n\n--- \n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\n\nThe base Land Cruiser has a starting MSRP of $86,710 (after the $1,395 destination charge), and includes the V-8, full-time four-wheel drive, full-LED exterior lighting, sunroof, 18-inch wheels, four-zone climate controls, a multi-terrain camera with various exterior views, a wireless device charger, seating for eight, semi-aniline perforated leather seats, multi-stage heated and cooled front seats with 10-way power adjustments, folding rear seats, folding third-row seats, radar cruise control,, Siri Eyes Free, Bluetooth, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, a power liftgate, a JBL premium audio system with 14 speakers, a navigation system, and voice controls. \n\n![2019 Toyota Land Cruiser 40 1BE611985C7ACEC0E03623E9E7D0E0A1E5C30E83 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/51NaAtdcl7vJ5SEP4yKyAy/19c2c556826dc0d32eb19583df5321a1/2019_Toyota_Land_Cruiser_40_1BE611985C7ACEC0E03623E9E7D0E0A1E5C30E83__1_.jpg) \n\nToyota Safety Sense is also standard and includes a pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, lane departure alerts, a sway warning system, auto high beams, and dynamic radar cruise control. \n\nA $2,200 rear-seat entertainment system is optional, and includes two individual 11.6-inch screens with RCA jacks, HDMI inputs, a remote, and two wireless headphones.\n\nThere’s also the 2020 Land Cruiser Heritage Edition. For a base price of $87,645 plus destination, this iteration adds unique 18-inch bronze BBS rims, cuts the seating down to five passengers (no third row), upgrades the infotainment system to a bigger screen, and adds various badging and trim upgrades inside and out. \n\nIf you’re shopping for a Land Cruiser, stick to the basics. The Toyota comes stacked with almost any option you will ever need, and a couple of tablets will do just as well as the very expensive rear-seat entertainment package. The high base price may turn some people off, but the big value proposition with a Land Cruiser is that it will last forever with low maintenance costs. \n\n![2019 Toyota Land Cruiser 17 F1EE539126BBAA4FAF5F1CA50F9AA97D79387B5D (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/70F7Lfp43foilGg2OTXEVF/10396ce5cc9c097bb8c5e0d7358192ad/2019_Toyota_Land_Cruiser_17_F1EE539126BBAA4FAF5F1CA50F9AA97D79387B5D__1_.jpg) \n\n---\n\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n## Also consider\n\nThe Infiniti QX80 is quite a bit less expensive and has some of the newer tech that the Land Cruiser omits. The QX80’s interior is also nicer (it gets a sizable upgrade for 2020), but the truth is that both SUVs are in need of an overhaul. The Infiniti is also closest to the Land Cruiser's fuel economy, which is to say it's not very good on gas.\n\nThe Lexus LX is basically a Land Cruiser wearing fancier clothes. There’s no performance or capability benefit to paying a few thousand dollars more, but you do get some nicer trim pieces and a much more aggressive exterior design.  \n\nThe Mercedes-Benz G-Class is stuck in another time, but the price tag is totally modern. It starts around $125,000 and has some of the blockiest, most utilitarian looks of any vehicle on the road.\n\nThe Land Rover Range Rover has similar off-roading chops, but costs more and won’t match the Land Cruiser’s expected reliability. \n\nLuxury shoppers might also consider the BMW X7, Lincoln Navigator, or Cadillac Escalade, but both are significantly more expensive and lack the off-road credentials that the Land Cruiser has. With the Land Cruiser's longevity, buyers may also find themselves shopping new models against ones from a few years ago.\n",

      "body": "### Pros:\n\n- Sleek, beautiful profile.\n- Posh, comfortable interior with leather seats and lots of amenities.\n- Fine handling and acceleration.\n\n### Cons:\n\n- Limited headroom in the back and poor rear visibility due to the sloping roofline.\n- Inferior cargo space.\n- Outdated infotainment system.\n\n### Summary\n\nA coupe-like luxury sedan, the 2019 Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class boasts sleeker lines than earlier models, while the automaker has upped the stakes in terms of available technology and performance with an innovative new mild hybrid engine. The CLS-Class was redesigned for 2018, representing the third generation of the vehicle.\n\nThis vehicle comes in the CLS 450, CLS 450 4Matic and AMG CLS 53 trim levels, and ranges in price from just over $70,000 to nearly $100,000, depending on the trim and options. The 2019 CLS competes against the [Audi A7](https://www.autolist.com/audi-a7), [Porsche Panamera](https://www.autolist.com/porsche-panamera), as well as more traditional four-door luxury sedans such as the [Audi A6](https://www.autolist.com/audi-a6), [BMW 5 Series](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-5+series) and the [Mercedes-Benz E-Class](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-e+class) on which it's based.\n\n### Exterior\n\nTLDR: Praised as a sleek, beautiful upgrade, the 2019 CLS has simple lines to offset its bold fascia.\n\n![2019-mercedes-cls-exterior-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5kNSFYnijo3v7e6h23Ajiw/a4038c7c3c3ea64f61192cf6c551b56c/2019-mercedes-cls-exterior-1.jpg)\n\nBoasting the dramatic, swooping roofline typical of past iterations, the redesigned 2019 CLS features a long hood, raked roof, shark-nose fascia, short overhangs and sleek, flowing lines. Reviewers singled out this vehicle's looks as one of its principal virtues, noting that this luxury car has fewer lines or flourishes than earlier models. The CLS 450 models also have an angled rear, three air intakes, sharp two-part LED headlights with a stardust effect, a trunk-integrated spoiler and a prominent lower splitter. It also has 19-inch alloy wheels.\n\nThe base model 2019 CLS is roughly 2 inches longer and 0.3 inches wider than last year's car, and yet is 1.5 inches lower. Depending on the trim, the 2019 CLS is 55.3 to 56 inches tall, 74.4 inches wide and 196.4 to 196.9 inches long, and it has a wheelbase of 115.7 inches, 2.4 greater than the outgoing model. All models get an AMG styling package typical of high-performance Mercedes cars, which includes a diamond mesh on the grille. The CLS-Class shares many of its parts with the E-Class and S-Class models.\n\n![2019-mercedes-cls-exterior-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1faduc7KdQdA2hBgYiAI0y/d79eefbf73edbbc02136e69578e9f93c/2019-mercedes-cls-exterior-2.jpg)\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nTLDR: High-quality materials and elegant accents make the interior a picture of luxury, while the range of comfort settings ensures constant relaxation.\n\nThe interior of this third-generation Mercedes-Benz CLS has sumptuous leather upholstery, with optional Nappa leather at higher trim levels. Piano Black, open-pore wood detailing and brushed aluminum accents round out the interior styling. The optional Comfort Package adds a heated steering wheel and heated armrests along with heated and cooled front seats.\n\n![2019-mercedes-cls-interior-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/75nc1xd8Kcso1QscHqJeyl/b7f3da33e1a5494cbb2adbac61901ba5/2019-mercedes-cls-interior-1.jpg)\n\nThe CLS-Class boasts a curved MB-Tex dashboard similar to the S-Class, which wraps around the driver and front passenger. One flaw with the interior is that the roofline hurts rear visibility and limits back-seat headroom.\n\nThe ambient interior lighting cycles through 64 colors and lights in the air vents turn red when you dial up the temperature to warm and blue when you dial it to cool. Three-zone climate control keeps the interior comfortable, and the multi-contour front seats have a massage function for extra pleasure. Also, a 12.3-inch screen occupies the dashboard at every trim level, and both a controller on the center console and button-heavy touchpads on the steering wheel connected to the screen.\n\nReviewers agree that the interior is posh and beautiful, but some regret that the rear seat space has diminished from earlier models. This coupe-like sedan comes with an optional Energizing Comfort system that calibrates the vehicle's audio system, seats, lighting and climate control to the driver's pre-programmed specifications. This comfort system includes six pre-programmed settings for convenience, along with an Air Balance fragrance and air purification feature for maximum relaxation. Finally, two sets of LATCH anchors making installing car seats easy.\n\n![2019-mercedes-cls-interior-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6nTjdXHfCBWssd76JZrZ3I/3e80efae0280ecb55142e12c0635988d/2019-mercedes-cls-interior-2.jpg)\n\n### Utility and Practicality\n\nTLDR: This model has less room for storage than earlier ones.\n\nThis new CLS has 11.9 cubic feet of cargo space, just enough for nine grocery bags or a few items of luggage. \n\n![2019-mercedes-cls-exterior-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1IlEVZTwcuGktd79RCvyFg/e21259b9431a499a46984e0ab62464fa/2019-mercedes-cls-exterior-3.jpg)\n\nAlthough this vehicle has more cargo space than earlier models, sedans of this size tend to have 13 to 15 cubic feet of space. The trunk lid can be equipped with an optional hands-free power assist for added convenience.\n\n### Technology and Infotainment\n\nTLDR: Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are just two of the infotainment features on offer, and optional amenities such as premium sound systems and satellite radio abound.\n\nThe 12.3-inch center screen on the dashboard of this Mercedes provides navigation, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto access. Unfortunately, Mercedes' new MBUX infotainment system is not available as it is on smaller sedans like the A-Class and C-Class. Instead, this vehicle features the older COMAND system, with confusing outputs when you try to change the vehicle's settings or use the navigation system. Some reviewers dislike the system's glossy touchpad, which sits awkwardly over the control knob. However, the system responds to voice commands for convenience.\n\n![2019-mercedes-cls-interior-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3zsdXOfRrx0mRfXhzK1mCC/e63732fd212e3cefa280f8e054add0b9/2019-mercedes-cls-interior-3.jpg)\n\nA second 12.3-inch screen is available, replacing the analog gauges of the base model and sharing a glass panel with the first screen. With both screens in place, you can set your vehicle's cockpit to a personalized Sport, Progressive or Classic configuration.\n\nA wireless phone charging port is also available, as are two premium sound systems: the 13-speaker Burmester surround sound or 25-speaker Burmester High-End 3D surround sound systems. The CLS comes standard with two USB data ports. You can also purchase in-car Wi-Fi, a head-up display and SiriusXM satellite radio. Back-seat passengers also get access a 120-volt household-style plug, 12-volt outlet and USB charging port.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Safety and Driving Assistance\n\nTLDR: Although it doesn't have crash test ratings from IIHS or NHTSA, the 2019 CLS has enough driver assistance and safety features for semi-autonomous driving.\n\nThe 2019 Mercedes CLS has a wide range of safety features, such as adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning and blind-spot monitoring. The Active Lane Change Assist helps you steer into another lane when the road is clear, while Active Speed Limit Assist alerts you if you start going far above the speed designated for a given road.\n\nActive Distance Assist keeps your Mercedes a safe distance from the cars ahead and behind you, and Active Steering Assist holds your vehicle in the center of your lane. Also, Active Emergency Stop Assist brings your vehicle to a complete stop if it detects that you're not controlling it. This feature can even make emergency calls and unlock the doors so emergency response teams can get into the vehicle easily.\n\nAdditional safety features include Evasive Steering Assist, rear cross-traffic alert, driver drowsiness monitoring, automatic high beams, active speed assist and traffic sign recognition. The 2019 CLS also boasts Pre-Safe systems to protect occupants from impending collisions. The Pre-Safe Sound feature, for example, emits a sound during crashes to protect against hearing loss. Pre-Safe Plus, Pre-Safe Impulse Side and Pre-Safe 360 are also available.\n\nThe Driver Assistance Package and Driver Assistance Plus Package allow for semi-autonomous driving. The Car-to-X communication feature lets your vehicle receive warnings from other Mercedes cars of hazards ahead while driving. \n\nHowever, neither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration has released results for the 2019 CLS-Class.\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nTLDR: The six-cylinder engine may not be remarkable, but it gets the job done. The vehicle's handling is more impressive.\n\nThe brand-new turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine that comes on CLS 450 and 450 4Matic models is capable of 362 horsepower and 369 lb.-ft. of torque. It is only available with a nine-speed automatic transmission, but an electric boost system gives it a small surge of power when needed. \n\nThe AMG CLS 53 variant gets a more powerful version of this engine, with 429 horsepower and 384 lb.-ft. of torque. All-wheel-drive is also standard with this engine.\n\nMany reviewers praise the 2019 CLS for its seamless, responsive handling and comfortable ride. It can reach 60 mph from a stop in just 4.8 seconds in the CLS 450 4Matic with its all-wheel-drive system, and even rear-wheel-drive can reach 60 mph in a respectable 5.1 seconds. The CLS 53 model, meanwhile, can reach 60 mph in 4.4 seconds. Reviewers describe this vehicle as light and maneuverable, with good composure over mid-corner bumps.\n\nThe steering turns in nicely and stays direct while you drive, and the Air Body Control adaptive air suspension keeps the car level when you turn corners. You can adjust this suspension to Comfort, Sport and Sport+ firmness modes. Reviewers note that the previous CLS-Class' available V8 provided more power, however. Boasting quick gear-shifts and sharp throttle responses, this Mercedes-Benz has low-noise performance tires and a sound-deadening design to ensure the cabin is as quiet as possible. Also, the automatic transmission has a manual shifting mode. Braking was also considered by reviewers to be seamless and confidence-inspiring. \n\nThe 2019 CLS-Class has a top speed of 130 mph and a curb weight of 4,300 to 4,400 pounds.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Fuel Efficiency\n\nTLDR: Excellent fuel efficiency puts this Mercedes at the front of the pack.\n\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, the Mercedes-Benz CLS 450 gets 23 mpg on city streets, 31 mpg on the highway and 26 mpg combined. The 4Matic all-wheel-drive version drops fuel economy by 1 mpg in both city and highway ratings but keeps the same combined figure. \n\nThe CLS 53 version, by contrast, received a rating of 21 mpg city, 27 mpg highway and 23 mpg combined. \n\nThe all-wheel-drive [Audi A7](https://www.autolist.com/audi-a7), a rival of the Mercedes CLS, gets 22 mpg and 29 mpg on city roads and highways, respectively, while the 2019 [Mercedes-Benz E](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-e+class) 300 gets 21 mpg city and 29 mpg highway. Despite having the same torque and horsepower as the 2019 CLS, the larger 2019 [Mercedes-Benz S](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-s+class) 450 only gets 19 mpg city and 28 mpg highway. \n\nSome of the efficiency gains on the 2019 CLS 450 come down to the EQ Boost 48-volt mild hybrid system. When the vehicle accelerates, the EQ Boost — a starter-generator sitting between the engine and transmission — spins faster than a standard starter motor and starts the engine quicker, saving fuel. The EQ Boost also shoots a jolt of electricity at a moment's notice for extra torque and horsepower.\n\n### Trim Levels and Pricing\n\nTLDR: With trim levels in the upper five figures, the 2019 CLS sits squarely in the luxury price range.\n\nThe 2019 Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class starts at $70,195 for the CLS 450, including a $995 destination charge. Despite being the standard trim level, it boasts a wealth of amenities including adaptive dampers and a sunroof, as well as 64-color ambient lighting and a navigation system with real-time traffic reporting.\n\nThe __CLS 450__ also comes with an adjustable sport exhaust, LED exterior lighting and a power trunk lid. Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, a center display, and leather upholstery also come standard with this vehicle. All the amenities you can add to the CLS 450, such as the Burmester 3D High-End surround sound system or heated armrests, can bring the cost up to $95,950.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive __CLS 450 4Matic__ starts from $72,695 and features the same equipment as the rear-wheel-drive CLS 450, as well as the same options and packages.\n\nThe __AMG CLS 53__ is the premium package trim level, with a higher-performance turbo-six engine capable of 429 horsepower. It starts from $81,000, while options mimic those available on CLS 450 models.\n\n### Value\n\nCompared to its rivals, such as the Audi A7 or Porsche Panamera, the 2019 Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class is an outstanding deal. In the eyes of many reviewers, the vehicle's posh interior and sleek exterior, combined with its wealth of amenities, more than justify the starting price. If you're more interested in performance over luxury, the AMG CLS 53 may look disappointing compared to the significantly more expensive Porsche Panamera Turbo with its eight-cylinder engine capable of 550 horsepower. \n\nSome of the CLS' options don't come cheap, however. The Burmester 3D High-End surround sound system is one of the most expensive extras at $5,400, while the Driver Assistance Package and air suspension come in at a steep $2,250 and $1,900, respectively. \n\nIn the end, though, you're unlikely to find many four-door sedans as fun or luxurious as the CLS-Class.\n\n### More Photos\n\nSee more [2019 Mercedes CLS Photos](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-cls+class-2019/2019-mercedes-cls-photos).",

      "body": "You want to get a new car, but you haven’t paid off the one you have. You could sell your old set of wheels, clear the balance on your loan, and make a down payment on a new model with whatever cash is left over. However, to get a good price for your old car, you have to put up an ad, field phone calls, schedule appointments, invite strangers to your garage, and haggle over the price. If that sounds like too much work, you may be considering trading in your old vehicle. \n\nMany car dealerships accept trade-ins with vehicles that have not been paid off. Most of these dealerships even promise to pay off the balance on your auto loan. However, unless your local dealership is a charity, it will not make your loan disappear; it will pay off what you owe your lender and find a way to factor the expense it incurred into the price of the vehicle you purchase. Before you begin negotiations, you should understand how the trade-in process works to avoid unpleasant surprises down the road.\n\n![shutterstock 593571902 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4m2vrKKQPiBpaAdJT3qyUb/7dcffe4a8eb02e26911b54745473f5fb/shutterstock_593571902__1_.jpg) \n\n\n__How Trade-ins Work__\nWhen you approach a car dealership and ask to trade in your car, a representative will test drive it, appraise its value, and make you an offer. You may want to use estimates from online pricing guides such as Kelley Blue Book to negotiate the value of your trade-in and the price of the car you want. When you reach an agreement, you will calculate the difference you have to settle to get the new car and sign over the title of your old car to the dealership. To calculate the net cost of your new vehicle, the dealer will subtract the value of your old car from the price of the vehicle you want. If your 2012 Ford Focus is worth $6,000 and you negotiated the price of the 2017 model you are interested in down to $14,000, you will pay or make arrangements to finance the balance of $8,000.\n\nIf you owe money on the car you are trading in, the dealership pays off the loan, assumes ownership of your trade-in, and applies the difference between the value of your car and what you owed your old lender to the price of the vehicle you are going to purchase. If you owe $2,000 on your 2012 Ford Focus (which you agreed is worth $6,000), the dealer will pay off the loan and subtract the extra $4,000 ($6,000-$2,000) from the price of the car you purchase. Since the price tag on the 2017 model is $14,000, you will pay or finance the balance of $10,000.\n\n__Trading in With Negative Equity__\nIf you owe more on your old car than it is worth, your set of wheels has negative equity. In dealership parlance, it is upside down or underwater. In this case, the dealer will add the difference between the loan balance and the value of your trade-in to the price of your new car. Suppose, for example, that you still owe $8,000 on your 2012 Ford Focus. The dealer will take the car as a trade-in and add $2,000 ($8,000 loan balance minus $6,000 trade-in value) to the price of the new car you want.\n\nTake note that rolling over your negative equity to your new car loan increases your monthly payments because you are now paying interest on the principal and the roll-over amount. If you were to take out a 60-month, 9-percent-interest car loan on the $14,000 Ford, you would make monthly payments of $291, and the total interest you pay would be $3,460. If the dealer applies the negative equity from your old loan to the car, you would be servicing a $16,000 loan instead. Given the same term, and at the same interest rate, your monthly payments would be $332, and the total interest you pay would be 3,920.\n\n![shutterstock 1506335204 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/pagnysexebwL1wKxlsDvK/1c318e887ed19424ed8d22cef2df6ee0/shutterstock_1506335204__1_.jpg) \n\n__Beware of Trade-in Scams__\nBy law, the amount of negative equity a dealership rolls over into a new car loan should be reflected in loan disclosures as a refinancing of the old debt. Dishonest dealers who lure customers into their lots with the promise of making their auto loans disappear will use one of two strategies to bypass disclosure laws and recoup the money they lose when they settle the customer’s old loan.\n\nIn the first instance, the dealership will offer you more for your old car than it is worth and inflate the price of the vehicle you are buying. If your 2012 Ford Focus is worth $6,000 and you have $2,000 in negative equity, a dealer may offer you $8,000 for your old car and sell you the 2017 model at $19,000. You may think you are scoring a great deal because the dealer is covering your negative equity and paying you $2,000 more for your trade-in than it is worth. However, the dealer is making an extra $1,000 in profit because the best price you could get on the new Ford is $14,000. The dealer knows that you will be too ecstatic about making a killing on your old car to question the price of the vehicle you are buying.\n\nIn the second instance, a dealer will offer you financing terms with a high-interest rate as a precondition for accepting your trade. The dealership recovers the cost of covering your negative equity from the extra interest it gains. In this case, the dealership violates the Truth in Lending Act because it deprives you, the customer, of the opportunity to refinance the negative equity through other means.\n\n__Is It Ever a Good Idea to Trade in When You Have Negative Equity?__\nIf you have the money, it is a good idea to pay off the difference between what you owe your lender and the value of your old car before you finance a new vehicle. This way, you don’t have to pay interest on the negative equity that would be rolled over into the new loan. If you don’t have the cash, the next best option would be to wait on getting that new set of wheels until you pay off your auto loan or at least until you have enough to cover the negative equity.\n\nGranted, there are a few circumstances when trading in a financed vehicle may be a good idea. If your old car is a gas guzzler or costs more in repairs and maintenance than you anticipated, you could save money by trading it in for a cheaper model or for a vehicle that costs less to run. It may also be a good idea to trade in if the dealership offers extra incentives on the car you are eyeing. Toward the end of the year, dealerships often offer substantial discounts and better deals on car loans to meet sales quotas and make room for newer models.\n\n![shutterstock 491969521 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6DKVLOqGSf1MB0eXGeAKkT/6ad99b8a0efd92b8c8cc5d51a8fcd714/shutterstock_491969521__1_.jpg)\n\n__Bottom Line__\nMany car dealerships promise to pay off your trade-in, but they only mean it if your old vehicle is worth more than you owe on your auto loan. If you are upside down on your car loan and the promise to clear off your debt sounds too good to be true, it probably is. One way or another, the dealership will add the difference between your car loan and the value of your old vehicle to the price of your next purchase. Keep in mind that if you can sell your used car yourself, you can keep more of the equity that disappears when you take a wholesale offer from an auto dealership.",

      "body": "Invoice price, often just called the dealer cost, is the price on the invoice sent by the manufacturer to the dealer when the car comes from the factory. This price isn't always disclosed to buyers directly.\n\nThat means it's up to you to figure out how to find the dealer invoice price. One of the best ways to determine what the invoice price is to look at Consumer Reports. However, before investigating this matter further, it's time to learn a bit more about the invoice price and how it affects your car buying experience.  \n\n### The Importance of the Invoice Price\n\nThe goal of most car buyers is to negotiate a price on a new vehicle that is significantly lower than the sticker price, also known as the MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price). A more attractive approach is to try for the dealer invoice cost, which is essentially the price the dealer paid to the vehicle's manufacturer. Usually, the dealer will have paid much less than the dealer invoice price that's publicized for the vehicle.\n\nIn some situations, the salesperson may show you something similar to an invoice to make you believe they aren't profiting much from the vehicle's sale.\n\nEach car has an invoice and retail cost, for all the trim levels and each of the options. The full invoice cost on most vehicles usually spans from several hundred up to several thousand below the sticker price. One vehicle this might happen with, for example, is the 2019 Honda CR-V EX-L. It has a sticker price of just over $30,000 and may have an invoice cost that is approximately 7% lower (about $27,900).\n\nThe fact is though, dealerships sell vehicles under the invoice price each day and remain in business. Most dealers paid much less than the advertised invoice price when the car was purchased from the automaker. The MSRP is just a number that shows what the automaker would like to receive from the customer, and the invoice cost is what the carmaker wants to obtain from the dealership. In all honesty, neither of these numbers have much effect on the price you pay for a vehicle.\n\nWhen a car is extremely popular, or just launched, dealers are going to charge the total sticker price, and sometimes more. As the car ages, though, more and more consumers are going to be unwilling to pay the full MSRP. Also, dealers aren't going to be paying the entire invoice cost.\n\n### How much less are they going to pay?\n\nThat is something that varies from one dealer to another, base don the bonuses and discounts received.\n\nWhile this is true, knowing the ins and outs of invoice pricing can be beneficial for your car buying journey.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### How Accurate are the Websites that Display Auto Invoice Prices?\n\nSeveral websites display auto invoice prices, and that provides valuable research and information when you are ready to buy a vehicle. Even though this is the case, there are some charges on invoices that aren't displayed on websites. \n\n__Some of these charges are listed here:__\n\n- The Mid-Year Pricing Adjustments\nMost manufacturers adjust their prices at the halfway point of any model year. Because the mid-year price adjustments may be difficult to determine, not all manufacturers disclose the information to the websites. It's also a challenge for a website's pricing information to show these changes. If you discover one vehicle is more expensive than another, then it may be the mid-year adjustment that's to blame.\n\n- Online Marketing Fees\nSome manufacturers offer web design services for dealerships. These online tools don't come free. The online marketing fees are charged to the dealership through the new vehicle invoice. Not all dealerships take part in the online marketing program, which means the charge may not be on all invoices.\n\n- Direct Advertising Charges\nManufacturers also offer regional advertising groups that dealerships can opt to take part in. The district ad charges are used for paying for television and newspaper advertisements. The costs for taking part in this are passed on through the new vehicle invoice.\n\n- Why Doesn't the Dealer Pay Invoice?\nSeveral dealers pay less than what's listed on the official invoice price of the vehicle when buying the cars from the manufacturer. A dealer gets some of these by their willingness to negotiate a price that's under the MSRP, but most car shoppers will not know what the dealership paid for the vehicle.\n\n### How Discounts Can Affect the Dealer's New Car Costs\n\nSome new vehicles have \"secret\" programs that can help to discount the price further. Some of these discounts include special programs, cash back, dealer holdback, factor to dealer incentives, and customer rebates.\n\nIf you aren't sure if the vehicle you are considering has this discount, the dealer will not offer it to you upfront. If the dealer doesn't let you know about the extra money, they have the opportunity to make more money on the deal. If you ask about one, some dealers will negotiate the total amount with you. Take note that a dealer holdback isn't a discount. It's extra money that many car dealers are going to negotiate.\n\nIt's a good idea to familiarize yourself with these additional savings to make sure you are paying the lowest price possible. After you determine the fair profit offer, you can use this as a base for your negotiations. You can also use it to compare to free online price quotes sent by dealers to ensure you don't pay too much on the final purchase price.\n\n### What is the Average Profit Made by a Dealer?\n\nThe average dealer profit is dependent on several factors. The make of a vehicle, regardless of whether it is used or new, and demand will influence the profit a dealer makes. Those who work in the used car business are going to have several profit margins on each vehicle.\n\nIn extreme cases of luxury vehicles or trucks, the vehicle is sold at twice what they paid for it. But in other situations with economy cars or older models, the markup is virtually non-existent. When selling a new car, the markup is calculated as a percentage of the total cost. However, it's not unusual to see an average of five to 10 percent profit for both new and used vehicles.\n\n### Additional Profit Centers\n\nSelling a vehicle isn't what helps a dealer make money. It's the add-ons and financing that are sold through the financing office at the dealership. There are several ways that money is made on financing.\n\nFor example, the dealership can earn one to three percent in commission for any loan they make for outside lenders, such as credit unions, banks, and other financing company. It's also possible for the dealer to increase the interest rate on the loan. They can take at least some of the difference between what's paid to the bank and what the customer is charged as profit.\n\nNew car dealers also make a lot of money from the add-ons that are sold in the finance office. Some of these items include gap insurance, extended warranties, nitrogen for the tires, window etching, and more. Before agreeing to any add-ons, find out if they are really necessary, or  if you can get a comparable product for less away from a third-party car lot.\n\nDealers are also making money on other fees that are considered \"normal\" with a car purchase. While some of the costs, such as the title, licensing, and destination charges aren't negotiable. Others, however, are. Add-ons, advertising fees, documentation fees, and other things you never asked for are typically able to be negotiated.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### A Customer Trade-In\n\nAccording to experts, you need to separate your trade-in from the new car price negotiations. That's because it's straightforward to manipulate the numbers when you use a trade-in. You may believe you got your new vehicle for $1,000 less than the invoice price, but what you may miss is that the dealership is giving you $1,000 less than what your old vehicle was worth.\n\n### What Do Dealerships Have to Pay For?\n\nWhile it's crucial for customers to look for every chance to save money when buying a car, they also need to remember it's a business transaction and the dealer needs to make some profit. After all, they must finance the inventory, pay employees, improve the building, advertise and more.\n\nWhile the invoice price may not be a number that shows the real cost of a vehicle to a dealership, consumers are probably never going to know what a dealer paid to get the car to their lot. In fact, there's a good chance the salesperson working with you doesn't even know the real dealer cost.\n\n### Tips for Finding Secret Dealer Money Online\n\nAs mentioned above, dealers don't typically advertise the factory to dealer incentives to consumers, which makes it hard to know if any are available. The dealer will share customer cash and rebates because they are advertised publicly as a way to get more consumers interested in the vehicle.\n\nIf you see an advertisement that showcases a low price for a vehicle, make sure to read the fine print and find out if the dealer used the incentive to get the advertised price. If you do this, it will let you know what the incentives offered for the vehicle are and if you qualify.\n\nWhile finding out the dealer's true cost for a vehicle is challenging, it's not impossible. Just keep the information here in mind when you are shopping and ask the salesperson if they can reveal the invoice that was sent from the manufacturer at the time of purchase.",

      "body": "Title washing is a common but illegal way to boost the value of a damaged car. It involves moving the vehicle to another state that doesn't recognize its branded title – be it a flood title, salvage title, rebuilt title, or another adverse issue. Once the vehicle receives a clean title, its value shoots up, making it easier to sell. Here's a rundown on how title washing works, so you can avoid ending up with a lemon.\n\n### What Is Title Washing?\n\nWhen a car is badly damaged in a flood, fire, hailstorm, or natural disaster, the insurance company may declare the vehicle a total loss. A total loss means repairing the car costs almost as much as it's worth. State laws typically require the insurer to brand such a vehicle's title and registration with a designation indicating its flaws. Title washing sidesteps those laws to scrub the brand off the car, raising the vehicle's value in the process and removing any lienholders who may be attached to it. Title washing typically involves moving the vehicle to a state where the brand isn't recognized so that it can be registered with a clean title.\n\nMany car dealers and private sellers engage in title washing, even though the practice is illegal in most places. In Texas, for example, two people were given three-year prison sentences for title washing about 800 vehicles and had to pay $600,000 in restitution. More than 800,000 cars in the U.S. have washed titles, according to the vehicle history report site Carfax. Many title-washed vehicles in the Gulf States received flood damage from significant hurricanes like Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. The title-washed cars in New Jersey and New York received flood damage from Hurricane Sandy. These vehicles are dangerous to drive, as floodwater can damage a vehicle's wiring and corrode its parts.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### How Title Washing Works\n\nMany title-washed cars are former salvage titles, meaning their repair damage equals 50 to 100 percent of their market value. Unlike flood titles, salvage titles are generally given to cars that have been in accidents. Another way to wash the title is to alter the title document manually. Car titles don't always have digital counterparts, despite the U.S. Department of Justice creating the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS) to keep track of them. Alternatively, some states assign a salvage title to a vehicle's Vehicle Identification Number, or VIN, in their DMV files but not their titles. As a result, owners can repair and repaint the vehicle and sell it to unsuspecting buyers, sometimes without needing to switch states. Some people have even begun to sell stolen vehicles by tweaking their VINs to match those of salvage cars.\n\nAlthough title washing is a federal crime, several states don't enforce laws against it, such as Texas, California, Washington, Tennessee, Mississippi, Illinois, New Jersey, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Virginia and Georgia. Mississippi has the worst title washing problem in the country, with one out of 44.6 cars having a washed title — over seven times higher than the national average. One reason car title washing is easy is because each state has its threshold for declaring a vehicle a total loss. Some states compare the repair costs of a damaged vehicle to its value in working condition, while other states compare the vehicle's repair costs to its scrap value. Also, states often apply different names of titles for the same damage, such as junk, rebuilt and irreparable titles.\n\n### Why You Should Care About Title Washing Scams\n\nTitle washing is dangerous because you can end up buying a severely damaged used car without knowing it. It's best to get a vehicle history report on any vehicle you plan to purchase to avoid titling scams. Carfax provides history reports on millions of vehicles by pooling records from dealerships, manufacturers, auto and salvage auctions, U.S. and Canadian motor vehicle departments, and many other sources. Each car's history report includes all the accidents in which it was involved. Each report also consists of the vehicle's mileage history, so you can verify that the odometer is accurate. The National Insurance Crime Bureau also provides a VIN-checking service.\n\nFor additional safety, make sure you buy cars from reputable sellers and consider asking the seller for a written guarantee of the car's value. Licensed dealers are more trustworthy, as they risk losing their license if caught title washing. Always check that the seller's name matches the name on the title document. If it doesn't, ask the seller why. It's also a good idea to have an independent mechanic look over any used car you want to buy. Mechanics can detect hidden damage, such as car sections that have been bolted together instead of welded. If you suspect your vehicle has been title-washed, let your local law enforcement agency know.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Other Considerations\n\nThere are many other red flags that a vehicle has been title-washed. For example, online marketplaces such as eBay may show that a vehicle was sold as damaged despite the vehicle's history report saying otherwise. Similarly, the car may have a rebuilt title even if its repairs deserved a salvage title. Keep in mind that nearly half the states in the U.S. let insurers decide on a car's value before declaring it a total loss. In some states, such as Colorado and Texas, the repair costs must be equal to or greater than the car's market value to qualify as a total loss. The Justice Department lacks detailed information on 13 percent of the vehicles in the U.S., in part because several states don't send the department this information.\n\nTitle washing has become an epidemic in the U.S. At a 2013 Florida State Senate hearing, a vehicle auction company claimed that about 1 in 7 cars it sold two years earlier couldn't be repaired and were only worth scrap. Altering titles is a temptation for dealers with many damaged cars on their hands, as they can get ten times more value from a vehicle with a clean title. That makes title washing a significant hazard for car buyers. Research any vehicle carefully before buying it.",

      "body": "Buying a used car can be a great way to save money on interest and depreciation during your ownership of a vehicle. However, without a little research, you could end up with a purchase that you'll regret. Buying a used car can sometimes be a gamble, but you can put the odds in your favor by being thorough in your research and inspection. Here’s a checklist of what to go over to ensure peace of mind. \n\n__Start With Research__\n\nBefore you start visiting dealerships or contacting private owners, it's important to do some research (which, if you’re reading this, you’ve already started, so nice job!). If you haven’t already, figure out what type of vehicle you want, then narrow it down to a few different models. \n\nOne reason for having a specific type of vehicle in mind early is that researching items on a minivan is going to be different from researching items on an SUV. Furthermore, all vehicles tend to have specific issues isolated by model and even isolated by different years of that model. Knowing exactly what type of issues might be present in your vehicle of choice gives you an excellent starting point in inspecting it for problems.\n\nAlso, make sure you have performed a [VIN check](https://www.autolist.com/guides/autocheck-vs-carfax) and ensured there are [no open recalls](https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls).\n\n__Model Research Check List:__\n\n- Common defects and problems\n- Basic maintenance costs and intervals\n- Repair costs\n- Aging price point\n- Features and options\n\nOnce you’ve learned a little about these areas of the vehicles you’re interested in, it’s time to test drive. Here’s a quick rundown of things to look for when you go to see a vehicle. \n\n---\n\n## Exterior:\n\n![shutterstock 1187588524 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3lJcXEagcGb7jFa4oAyx3N/89e6291e965dee4cf128f93ecbc73542/shutterstock_1187588524__1_.jpg)\n\n__Things to check:__\n- Body condition dents, rust, scratches, etc.\n- Look for uneven panels or mismatched paint\n- Doors, hood and trunk easy or difficult to open and close\n- Tire tread condition and wear\n- Same-branded tires\n- Light function and condition\n\n__Step 1: Body Condition__\nWhen you look at a vehicle that you're considering, it's important to go over it carefully before driving it.  Start with checking out the body condition. Walk around the vehicle and look for body surface defects such as scratches, dents or rust. Take note of whether there are any signs of mismatched paint as this could be a sign of a panel being replaced due to an accident.  Another clue is whether the body panels line up evenly.  Next, open and close all the doors, including the hood and trunk. Does everything close and open easily? Doors that are difficult to close or open might also be a sign of an accident. Check under the vehicle and around its wheel wells for rust; when you’re looking at the vehicle’s paint, look for signs of bubbling, which can indicate rust underneath. \n\n__Step 2: Tires__\nTake a look at the tires of your prospective car. Examine the tread by using the penny test. Place a penny with Lincoln's head side down into the tire grooves. If the head is completely visible, then the tread is badly worn and the seller should replace the tires. Look at the tread again and check to see if it has worn evenly on both sides. Uneven wear could indicate a problem with alignment. Check all the tires to see if they're the same brand; while different brands on one or more wheels isn’t necessarily a bad sign, inquire about the age of all the tires and why they’re a mismatched set. It's also a good idea to ask if the tires have been rotated regularly.\n\n__Step 3: Lights__\nNext up, check all the lights on the vehicle. Have the seller or a friend get into the car and turn on the headlights, running lights, high beams, fog lights if available and all the blinkers. Have them also depress the brake pedal to make sure those lights work. Physically examine all the light housings to look for damage such as cracks, foggy lenses or water. One of the signs of a flood-damaged vehicle is water in the light housings.\n\nOnce you’re satisfied with the outside of the vehicle, it’s time to look inside. \n\n---\n## Interior:\n\n![shutterstock 284519921 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/FbQRTftah3ATRmljwCdcd/c981b3b534bd3a2a2b8b8f80d283c438/shutterstock_284519921__1_.jpg)\n\n__Things to check:__\n- Signs of moisture or water damage\n- Unusual or offensive smells\n- Overly worn or torn upholstery\n- Seat adjustment equipment\n- Instrument cluster function and condition\n- Controls and switches working properly\n- Roof or top condition and signs of leaking\n\n__Step 1: Smell__\nThe first thing to notice is the odor in the car. The odor should be neutral or perhaps smell faintly of any air freshener item being used. If it smells like cigarette smoke or an animal, you may want to think twice as those smells are notoriously hard to remove. Another red flag is a musty or moldy smell. This tends to be a sign of either a flood-damaged vehicle or one with some type of leak. If you do smell this odor, make sure to check the interior closely for signs of mold or water damage. Ask about the vehicle’s history and what the reason is for the odor. \n\n__Step 2: Seats__\nCheck the seats next. Look at the upholstery and see if it's worn, stained or torn. If you suspect mildew from the first step, examine the seats carefully for signs of water damage. A leaking roof or window seals could also cause this, not just flood damage. Check the controls on the seats, whether manual or power, to make sure they all work properly. Specifically, check the driver's seat adjustments to ensure that you can find a comfortable position. Also make sure all of the seatbelts throughout the vehicle work — strap, buckle and retractor. \n\n__Step 3: Instruments and Controls__\nSwitch the car on into accessory mode. All the warning lights should come on for a second before flashing off again. Turn the car on and see if any of the lights stay on. Any light that stays on should be checked out. Complete your instrument check by making sure all the controls work how they should. Check the climate control and make sure the heater and AC if available work properly and switch on the audio system as well.\n\n__Step 4: Roof__\nInvestigate the roof by checking the headliner and trim. Check the seals around the windows and make sure any sun or moonroof isn't leaking. If the vehicle has a soft top, convertible or removable hard top, make sure to check that everything fits properly and isn't leaking. On older vehicles, make sure the headliner isn’t sagging or coming undone from the ceiling itself. \n\n__Check Under the Hood__\nThe next goal is to check under the hood. Even if you aren't a mechanic, there are a few things to look for. Look at all the belts and hoses to ensure that they aren't overly worn, fraying or loose from their ends. Look at the radiator and make sure it isn't stained or cracked. Check the underside of the hood for signs of fluid dripping off it; if you see this, it could be a sign of a blown gasket or hose that then leaked. \n\nCheck all the fluids in the car, including the engine oil, transmission, power steering and brake. Make sure the fluid levels are good and that there's no sign of leaking underneath the car. Oil color should be a warm brown. Dark brown or black suggests that the oil needs to be changed, which might say something about how the car is taken care of. Light brown means it has just been changed. Make sure there are no water droplets on the dipstick or gray, foamy fluid. These could be signs of a blown head gasket or cracked block. Transmission fluid should smell like oil and be pinkish. Brown fluid with a burnt odor could indicate problems.\n\n---\n## Test Drive\nThis is the most crucial part of your inspection. Take the car on both the highway and city streets. Vary your speed and try to climb and descend at least one hill. Make sure there are no unusual vibrations or noises and that the transmission shifts smoothly. Make sure that it accelerates smoothly and doesn't lose power on inclines. Check the brakes in both a gradual and sudden stop situation to see how they perform. Let the car idle at some point as well to make sure it idles smoothly and doesn't drop or lope. While you're doing this, you can also observe the exhaust and ensure that it's not cloudy and white, black or blue-tinged.\n\n---\n\n## Final Steps\nThe final steps to buying a used car are to have it professionally inspected by a mechanic and get a vehicle history report. Make sure the VIN matches everywhere on the vehicle and that it matches the registration. Another tip is to make sure that the registration and title match the person selling you the car or someone in the household. Also, make sure the seller has the title of the vehicle in hand; be wary of sellers who have a complicated story as to the whereabouts of the physical title. \n\n__Final Checklist:__\n- Proper fluid levels and condition\n- No signs of leaking\n- Hoses and belts not worn or cracked\n- Test drive for shaking, noises and proper operation\n- Smooth idle\n- No exhaust issues\n- Paperwork checks out\n- Mechanic inspection",

      "body": "As a Florida motor vehicle owner, your driver license proves your legal privilege to drive, and your certificate of title proves the vehicle belongs to you. If you want to buy, sell, or give away your prized ride, you must complete a Florida car title transfer. Knowing how to comply with the rules enables a smooth transition to the new owner.  \n\n### When is a Florida Car Title Transfer Required?\n\nSeveral situations require a transfer of title under Florida law. When you buy a motor vehicle or mobile home from a dealer, the dealer handles the paperwork to deliver the title to you, but when you buy it from a private seller, you handle the car title transfer. If you give, donate or inherit a vehicle, it requires the transfer of the vehicle title to the new owner. If you are a lienholder, you must complete the car title transfer process after releasing the lien. A name change triggers a transfer of title because you need a title certificate in your new name. \n\n### Agencies Authorized to Transfer Florida Titles\n\nIn the state of Florida, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV) in Tallahassee is responsible for issuing title certificates. County tax collector offices act as DHSMV agents to provide the services you need for transfer of titles. For example, for an additional $10 fee, the Alachua County Tax Collector issues a certificate of title when the transaction occurs, or you can have the DHSMV return the paper title to your address within four weeks. Under Florida law, you can hold an electronic title and request a paper title if you need it.\n\n### Benefits of Florida's Electronic Lien and Title (ELT) Program\n\nConsider asking for an electronic title instead of a paper title for your next Florida car title transfer. Florida's Electronic Lien and Title (ELT) program offers several benefits. Choosing an electronic title for your motor vehicle lowers costs and reduces risk of title loss, theft, and fraud. The ELT program enables state agencies to provide better customer service and allows faster notification of lien satisfactions.  If you decide to trade in your motor vehicle to a Florida motor vehicle dealer, the title stays in its electronic form and the dealer takes care of the paperwork.\n\nAt the time you transfer your motor vehicle or mobile home, ask to place the title in electronic status. Once you have an electronic title and request a paper title, it's converted to paper for a $2.50 service fee and mailed to you. To get a printed title, go to www.GoRenew.com. Some tax collector's offices provide Fast Title for $10. With Fast Title, the office prints your electronic title immediately while you wait. \n\n### How to Transfer an Electronic Title\n\nWhen you sell a motor vehicle for which you hold an electronic title, you can transfer the title electronically if the buyer agrees. You and the buyer complete and sign a secure reassignment document at the Tax Collector's office. The document states the odometer reading. If the buyer does not agree to an electronic transfer, print a paper title to transfer ownership. \n\n### Paper Car Title Transfer for Private Buyers\n\nWhen buying a motor vehicle from a private seller with a paper title, you need several items to complete the car title transfer. You should have a bill of sale from the seller as proof of ownership. The seller must complete the transfer section of the paper title and give it to you. If you see any liens on the title, ask for a copy of the lien satisfactions. You want proof of satisfaction, so you won't be on the hook for paying the lienholder. Get an Application for Certificate of Title With/Without Registration (Form HSMV 82040) and fill it out in your name. Fill out the Florida Insurance Affidavit (Form HSMV 83330) and have proof of Florida insurance, such as your auto policy or insurance card.\n\nAs of 2019, the title transfer fees in Florida are $75.25 for an electronic title or a $2.50 additional fee for a paper title. If you place liens on the vehicle, they cost $2 each. License plate and vehicle registration fees depend on the vehicle's weight. An initial $225 fee for motor vehicle registration applies to private cars, motorhomes and trucks weighing less than 5,000 pounds. Your vehicle may qualify for certain exemptions.\n\nTo ensure a smooth transaction, ask the seller to go with you to the local tax collector's office to complete the vehicle title transfer. If you are not in Florida, mail your forms and fees to your county tax collector.\n\n### Transfer of Title by Private Sellers\n\nIf you are selling your vehicle, give your buyer an original bill of sale that includes the vehicle identification number (VIN), vehicle description, date of sale and purchase price. It's wise to have it notarized for extra security and to keep a copy. Go with the buyer to the county tax collector office if you can to help ensure a successful transfer. Whether you go or not, submit a Notice of Sale or Bill of Sale for a Motor Vehicle, Mobile Home, Off-Highway Vehicle or Vessel (Form HSMV 82050) to the Florida DMV. This document lets the state know the vehicle is not in your name. While the DMV is processing the state title transfer, this notice protects you in case the new owner violates any Florida laws.\n\n### How New Florida Residents Transfer Title\n\nAre you a new Florida resident, or are you planning a move to the state? If so, you must obtain a new vehicle title, initial registration, and a Florida license plate. Complete the application for title, which is Form HSMV 82040. You need the Florida Insurance Affidavit, Form HSMV 83330, with proof of Florida insurance. Also, submit a VIN verification, which you can complete at the local Florida Department of Highway Safety office. As an alternative, submit Form HSMV 82042, Vehicle Identification Number and odometer verification.\n\nYour Florida title transfer fees are $77.25 for an out-of-state title transfer fee for an electronic title, $2 to record a lien, and $225 for a new-to-Florida vehicle fee, as of 2019. For a paper title, the charge is $2.50 more. Registration and license plate fees depend on your vehicle's weight and the type of plate you choose. Deliver your documents and fees in person or by mail to your county tax collector's office. If you request a paper title, expect to receive it within five business days after submitting your title application. \n\nThe process for completing a Florida car title transfer is fast and efficient when you understand it. Make a checklist of what you need and complete the title application and forms carefully before submitting them. Ask questions, follow the rules and get on the road legally.\n\n### Popular Searches in Florida\n\n - [Tampa Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/tampa-fl)\n - [Miami Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/miami-fl)\n - [Orlando Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/orlando-fl)\n - [Jacksonville Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/jacksonville-fl)\n - [Pensacola Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/pensacola-fl)\n - [Tallahassee, Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/tallahassee-fl)\n - [Gainesville, Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/gainesville-fl)\n",

      "body": "__Highlights:__\n\n- Consumers were evenly split on whether they would prefer a Ford Mustang Mach-E or Tesla Model Y, 51/49%.\n\n- Forty-six percent of respondents said they didn't like Ford's use of 'Mustang' for the new electric crossover; 20 percent did like the choice; 34 percent were undecided.\n\n- Consumers who chose the Ford cited the brand's dealer and service network, trust in Ford, and the Mach-E's styling as key reasons. \n\n- Shoppers who chose the Tesla said they liked the brand's Supercharging network, the Model Y's expected performance, and the Tesla brand overall. \n\n---\n__Full story:__\n\nConsumers can’t seem to agree on whether the Tesla Model Y is better than the Ford Mustang Mach-E.\n\nBut they’re united on one thing: they don’t like the Mustang name on this new EV.\n\n![Screen Shot 2019-11-20 at 11.23.42 PM](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6XwM8nVPwyaO8rfS4D8Wig/5bd81d19d0a7da012dfcc3077ab1ddcd/Screen_Shot_2019-11-20_at_11.23.42_PM.png)\n\nAutolist.com surveyed approximately 1,000 consumers in the days after Ford’s first-ever Mach-E was revealed and asked them which they would prefer: the Mustang or the Tesla Model Y. The results were extremely close: 51 percent of respondents choose the Ford Mach E while 49 percent of consumers choose the Tesla.\n\nYet a little under half of the respondents (46 percent) said they didn’t like the fact that Ford used the Mustang name on its first-ever Mach-E. Just 20 percent of consumers did like the name, with the remaining 34 percent undecided.\n\n![Screen Shot 2019-11-20 at 11.29.20 PM](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4uDBGnnPl0kdWJGVogtH4g/bc790b9a423de56fe8eeb62e15f1e07d/Screen_Shot_2019-11-20_at_11.29.20_PM.png)\n\nThe use of the Mustang name was a calculated gamble on Ford’s part as the automaker looks to leverage perhaps its best-known car in an effort to boost awareness of the Mach-E and boost its performance credibility. \n\n“Mustang is practically its own subbrand with huge name recognition that should help Ford’s critical foray into EVs,” said Chase Disher, analyst at Autolist.com. “But at the same time, the automaker has to endure howls of protest from the pony car faithful who hate seeing an icon’s legacy get appropriated.”\n\nThe Mach-E name is derived from the Mach 1, a high-performance iteration of the Mustang that Ford made throughout the 1970s and again from 2003 to 2004. \n\nFord’s all-new electric crossover was revealed ahead of the 2019 L.A. Auto Show in a warehouse practically adjacent to Tesla’s design center and the SpaceX headquarters. The choice of location was a not-so-subtle indication from Ford that it was targeting one particular brand with its Mach-E. \n\nBoth the Tesla Model Y and Ford Mustang Mach-E are set to land in consumers’ driveways in 2020. When they do, they’ll have plenty in common: a price tag from the mid-$40,000 range to the mid-$60,000 range; rear-wheel- or all-wheel-drive; a range of 210 to 300 miles, depending on the model; and hands-free driving capabilities. \n\nConsumers’ even split in Autolist’s poll on the two EV crossovers is an indication that Ford got many elements of the Mach-E right. \n\n“Tesla has long been seen as an innovator in the electric vehicle space, so for a legacy automaker like Ford to come in and match the Model Y’s competitiveness is a good sign for Ford,” Disher said. “It shows that Tesla may not have the stranglehold on the Model Y segment that it currently has with the Model 3.”\n\nAfter consumers indicated which of the two vehicles they would choose, Autolist asked them to pick three reasons why they choose that model. \n\nThe top five most common answers by consumers who choose the Ford Mustang Mach-E were:\n- Prefer/trust Ford more\n- The Mach-E’s exterior styling\n- Ford’s established dealer and service network\n- The Mach-E’s expected reliability\n- Concerns about Tesla’s future\n\n\nThe top five most common answers by consumers said they’d choose the Tesla Model Y were:\n- Prefer/trust Tesla more\n- Expected reliability\n- The Model Y’s expected performance\n- Tesla’s Supercharging network\n- Dislike of the Ford brand\n\nFor the Ford fans, key attributes that stood out were the brand’s dealer and service network and the Mach-E’s styling. \n\n“This poll showed that Ford’s existing network of 2,100 certified dealers could be a crucial asset for the Mach-E for consumers who might be wary of jumping into their first electric vehicle,” Disher said. \n\nTesla’s advantages, meanwhile, lie in the strength of the Tesla brand itself -- and its robust Supercharging network. \n\n“Because the brand started out with luxury, high-performance models (Roadster, Model S, Model X) before moving to the mainstream Model 3 and Y, consumers still see plenty of desirability in the Tesla name,” Disher said. “That, plus its Supercharging network to [relieve anxiety about range](https://www.autolist.com/news-and-analysis/survey-electric-vehicles), makes for a potent combo.”\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "American muscle cars have been a staple of the automotive market for decades. Initially designed for drag racing, muscle cars are high-performance cars that often feature V8 engines, rear-wheel-drive, and light two-door bodies. Muscle cars are prized for speed and power above all. Since the first American muscle car was released in 1949 — the Oldsmobile 88 — dozens have come and gone, with many becoming collectibles. Here are the top best American muscle cars, both classic and new.\n\n## Classic Muscle Cars\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s are widely regarded as the heyday of the American muscle car.

      "body": "Purchasing a new or used vehicle is still one of the higher transactions the average person will make in their lifetime. However, there are ways that you can make the car buying process less expensive. Here are some things to look at if you're looking at the cheapest way to buy a car.\n\n### Buy A Cheap Car With Cash\n\nProbably the cheapest way to buy a car is always to pay cash. When you pay interest on an item that actively depreciates, you're not just losing money once, but twice. Take a look at a typical financing deal. If the sales price on the car is $27,000 and out the door, it costs $30,000, but you put $5,000 as a down payment, then you end up financing $25,000. If your interest rate is 6.9 percent, you'll pay over $3,600 in interest by the end of the loan period. But that's not all the extra money you'll pay. The average car depreciates about 20 percent in the first year and then 15 percent in each subsequent year. So this example car will lose about $13,700 in value during that same loan period. In other words, you'll lose about $17,400 total on the deal. If you pay with cash on a used car, you won't pay the interest, and you won't be paying for as much depreciation either.\n\n### Get Pre-approved If You Aren't Paying All In Cash\n\nIf you don't have all of the cash needed for a new car purchase, then the least you can do is get pre-approved for a car loan before going to a dealership. That will allow you to get competitive interest rates from the dealership versus your pre-approved rate. In terms of the loan itself, it's best to keep the loan to 48 months or fewer, and the monthly payment shouldn't go over 15 percent of your monthly take-home income.\n\n### Research Your New Vehicle and Stay Flexible\n\nTry not to attach yourself to only one type of vehicle or one make and model. The more discerning you are, the harder it is to find a good deal. Think of the vehicle needs that you have on an everyday basis, not the occasional want. For example, if you don't regularly haul large items, then you probably don't need a pickup truck for everyday use. It's easy enough to rent a pickup truck when you do need this. Save money on gas by purchasing a passenger car instead.\n\n### Find Out The True Ownership Cost\n\nIt's not enough to know what the car costs, but you should also know what the cost of owning that car will be. The true cost of ownership includes what you'll pay in gas, insurance, repairs, taxes, licensing, maintenance, and more. You can get an idea of the true cost to own various vehicles by using the free tool on Edmunds.com.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Rent Before Buying\n\nTest-driving a car at the dealership can give you a brief idea about how it feels to own. But the key term is brief. Considering that buying a vehicle is bound to be one of your larger purchases, it's a good idea to be as sure as possible that it's what you want. If you can find the same model at a rental outfit, you might consider renting it for a week to see how it works with your needs and lifestyle. Weekly rental prices have only gotten more reasonable in recent years.\n\n### Buy A Car At The Right Time\n\nThere are better times than others to get a good deal on a new car. One of the best times is at year-end sales. At this point, dealerships are trying to make their annual goals and get rid of the previous model years left on their lots. However, car sales can be difficult when cold weather yields fewer car shoppers in many places. And at other times, take advantage of dealer quotas at the end of the month, end of the quarter and beginning of the week.\n\n### Scope Out Old Car Inventory\n\nDealerships have to turn over inventory in a reasonable amount of time to stay profitable. Any vehicle sitting on the lot for a long time is likely to be ripe for a good deal. How do you find these vehicles? There are a few clues. They may have unusual paint colors compared to the rest of the cars on the lot. If you look up close, you might notice dust in hidden places that the car lot washers often miss, such as beneath spoilers. Once you find a vehicle that looks like it's overstayed its welcome, open the driver's door and look at the door jamb. The manufacture date of the car should be over three months old for domestics and a bit longer for import cars. Another way to look for slow sellers is to search car ads online and filter the dates.\n\n### Consider Membership Warehouses\n\nYou may not realize that it's possible to buy a new car at a warehouse such as Costco or Sam's Club. Not only that, but you can usually get a no-hassle price. The reason for this is that they have already negotiated a price on the vehicle. You can look for your vehicle online and then go to the nearby partner dealership and get the car for the preset amount.\n\n### Don't Get Expensive Options\n\nUpscale trims and luxury options don't hold much value when it comes to selling the vehicle used. It especially applies to tech options, which become outdated quickly. Not only that, but many electronic options inside the car are just one more thing that can break down and need repair. \n\n### Get A Manual Transmission\n\nThat especially applies if you're looking for a reliable used car. Fewer Americans than before can drive a manual, so the price is typically lower on these, whether it's new or used. Along with getting a good deal initially, you can usually keep saving with a manual. They generally get somewhat better gas mileage, and they can save on brake wear if appropriately driven. Transmission repairs on a manual are usually far less costly since the main moving part is the clutch. Some estimates say you can save up to $30,000 over your lifetime if you only own vehicles with a manual transmission.\n\n### Buy Below Invoice\n\nCar buyers often assume that the invoice price is the lowest price they can get. They think that the car dealership paid this amount for the vehicle and won't let it go for that price and not under it. However, that's not true. The stated invoice price is not necessarily exactly what they paid for it. Not only that, but they may get incentives to sell certain vehicles, which makes it still profitable to sell them under invoice. If a dealership tries to convince you that the invoice price is the lowest they can go, you don't have to believe them. It's also essential to check for manufacturer rebates as the dealership is not obligated to tell you about those either.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Negotiate Online\n\nEven if you love haggling for a new car, it's generally better these days to shop online first. The dealer internet sales department will often quote lower prices than the lot salesperson. If you negotiate online, it also allows you to shop around and compare prices. You can get a quoted price and then email another dealership and ask if they can beat it.\n\n### Deal Separately With Your Trade-In\n\nIt's best to look at your trade-in and your potential new vehicle as two different transactions. Letting both be discussed at once is a good way to fall into various purchase price traps. If you have a used car in good condition, especially if it has low mileage, it would behoove you to sell it privately versus taking a dealer trade-in value on it.\n\n### Be Ready To Walk Away\n\nOne of the best tactics in your arsenal is the determination to walk away from a deal. If you have a firm price that you want to pay, it's easier to do that. There are many stories of people leaving a deal only to get a text or phone call from the dealership saying that they're now willing to let it go for your price.\n\n### Keep Your Smartphone Handy\n\nDuring negotiations, you can use your phone to look up terms you don't understand or to verify market values. You can even use it to compare prices on other lots if available. The salespeople are less likely to make false claims if they see that you have research material at your fingertips.\n\n### Always Thoroughly Read The Paperwork\n\nEven though there are incidences where the dealer made a mistake in the buyer's favor, this is usually not the case. If anything, they may try to slip something in that you won't see if you're not paying attention, or if you don't read the paperwork. It's also a good idea to have the person with you read it as well. And always have someone with you when you go to buy a car.\n\n### Be Willing to Refinance\n\nYou may choose to finance your vehicle through the automaker's credit to get incentives, but you should also see if you can line up refinancing. Start by making sure there are no penalties for this and then get a pre-approval from your lender. One of the cheapest ways to buy a new car is to take sizable rebates in trade for a higher interest rate, and then refinance the loan after 30 days to get a lower interest rate. You then save money in two directions.",

      "body": "### Pros:\n\n- One of the safest subcompact SUVs  \n- Capable in bad weather and off-road  \n- Comfortable ride  \n\n### Cons:  \n\n- Poorly-rated acceleration  \n- Higher starting price than some competitors  \n- Noisy cabin from engine and CVT transmission  \n\n### Summary \n\nThe 2019 Subaru Crosstrek is a subcompact crossover SUV which is currently in its second generation of production.  \n\nThe Crosstrek competes with other small SUVs like the [Hyundai Kona](https://www.autolist.com/hyundai-kona), [Mazda CX-3](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-cx+3), [Honda HR-V](https://www.autolist.com/honda-hr+v), [Ford EcoSport](https://www.autolist.com/ford-ecosport), [Fiat 500X](https://www.autolist.com/fiat-500), [Toyota C-HR](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-c+hr), [Jeep Renegade](https://www.autolist.com/jeep-renegade), [Chevrolet Trax](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-trax), [Mini Cooper Countryman](https://www.autolist.com/mini-cooper+countryman), and [Buick Encore](https://www.autolist.com/buick-encore).   \n\nSeveral new features are now offered on more trim levels this year, and more safety features are offered on base models for 2019. Additionally, a plug-in hybrid powertrain is now available.  \n\nIntroduced in 2013, the Subaru Crosstrek was redesigned for 2018. It is smaller than the [Forester](https://www.autolist.com/subaru-forester) and [Outback](https://www.autolist.com/subaru-outback) two-row crossovers siblings, being very similar in size to the [Impreza](https://www.autolist.com/subaru-impreza) hatchback, with more ground clearance. \n\n### Exterior \n\nTLDR: The Crosstrek looks like a Subaru hatchback with higher ground clearance.\n\nThe exterior of the Crosstrek follows Subaru's design language perfectly as it resembles the [Impreza](https://www.autolist.com/subaru-impreza) on which it's based.\n\n![2019-subaru-crosstrek-exterior-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2yFxcEnA5xsCjk0lVVsrKY/a0891815d7a43e8867fee655f1cd0c41/2019-subaru-crosstrek-exterior-1.jpg)\n\nA small, disproportionate hexagonal grille, the classic Subaru logo, and swept headlights characterize the front fascia. All come together to mimic a cheeky smiling face. Beyond this, a small lower grille opening and fog lights are the only other prominent features the Crosstrek possesses.  \n\nThe rear of the Crosstrek is very similar to that of a traditional hatchback car. A sizeable rear bumper, taillights that extend to the side of the vehicle, a flat hatch, and fairly steeply racked rear window are characteristics of many smaller SUVs, including the Crosstrek. Again, the [Subaru Impreza](https://www.autolist.com/subaru-impreza) hatchback retains a substantial influence in the rear design.  \n\nThe side profile of the Crosstrek resembles nothing more than a hatchback car with more ground clearance than usual. Plastic trim surrounds the bottom of the SUV and gives it a rugged appearance. Its short rear overhang makes it look smaller than it is, and its roofline forms a giant umbrella over all the side windows.  \n\n![2019-subaru-crosstrek-exterior-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7qMfdyCW3ICoDMDhrmVfKe/a3723177fef6d76b79dd384a1f048909/2019-subaru-crosstrek-exterior-2.jpg)\n\nPrevious generations looked rounder, especially over the roofline and down the rear of the vehicle. The current generation Crosstrek has been given a more serious overall look with a sharper front end, more severe head and taillights, and a more purposeful roofline. Higher ground clearance than many rivals also gives it a tougher impression. \n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort  \n\nTLDR: Interior quality and comfort are both better than average for the class, but many report the cabin to be noisy.\n\nTesters conclude that interior quality is good for the class, and comfort is generally above average compared to the competition.\n\n![2019-subaru-crosstrek-interior-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/54nFZtEqse2N2I581mU3vN/2e0acbe68658da3804eb082538e84e68/2019-subaru-crosstrek-interior-1.jpg)\n\nMost testers agree that the seats are firm but are appropriately bolstered to eliminate sliding. Getting into the seats is easy for reviewers as well due to its increased ground clearance. Most agree that interior space is above average considering the Crosstrek's small size with ample legroom all around.  \n\nReviewers note that interior ergonomics, easy-to-use infotainment system, and straightforward information screens are all good, but do not lead the segment.  \n\n![2019-subaru-crosstrek-interior-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/30URVX2UhH7XZYfHYXv0jX/1d2ef7b1aaacdbdbf651e6dfe1b4015b/2019-subaru-crosstrek-interior-2.jpg)\n\nInterior materials are satisfactory, as expected by reviewers, similar to similarly priced rivals. One complaint that almost all reviewers have is the noise from the engine and road. Not being a luxury vehicle, some noise is expected by testers, but many agree that it is above normal even for the class.  \n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Utility & Practicality \n\nTLDR: The Crosstrek offers average cargo space but superior capability and utility with its standard all-wheel-drive system. \n\nUtility and Practicality are two of the Crosstrek's stronger qualities.  \n\nCargo space is average for the class with nearly 21 cubic feet of space when all seats are in place and over 55 cubic feet when the rear seats are folded flat. Reviewers universally love that the second row does fold flat to maximize the space in such a small vehicle. Many other competitors offer a flatter rear-end design to allow more upright cargo space.  \n\nCargo and passenger loading are both made easy by the Crosstrek's easily accessible height. Most loading situations do not require bending, and passenger entry does not require climbing into or falling into the seats.  \n\n![2019-subaru-crosstrek-exterior-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2JSHLWcYscqDT9aqthnicf/d552b449757025b33cdbc543ea5600ce/2019-subaru-crosstrek-exterior-3.jpg)\n\nAs with most other Subaru's, the Crosstrek is available with a plethora of other cargo accessories for additional storage, given that Subaru has a large following among people with active lifestyles. However, small-item interior storage is noted to be only acceptable by reviewers.  \n\nThe driving position is a pleasant surprise to reviewers. Many reviewers agree that it is among the best in the class. Coupled with excellent visibility all around, the Crosstrek is noted to be easy to drive.  \n\nSubaru's excellent all-wheel-drive system, along with its 8.7 inches of ground clearance, allows the Crosstrek more capability than many other competitors. Only the Jeep Renegade can top the Crosstrek's off-road capability, but most reviewers do not expect buyers to use the Crosstrek for serious off-roading.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Technology & Infotainment  \n\nTLDR: Technology is reasonably good for the class while the infotainment system is straightforward.  \n\nTechnology an infotainment offerings are mostly satisfactory for the vehicle in this class and price point.  \n\n![2019-subaru-crosstrek-interior-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4nZwhfsjYIORh8v0LhLNux/fca03eecc0fd80be0ce473992b8ee920/2019-subaru-crosstrek-interior-3.jpg)\n\nApply CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration are standard features along with Subaru's Starlink infotainment system. It is paired to a 6.5-inch touchscreen display and includes Bluetooth, voice controls, and a USB port.  \n\nOther standard technology features include a four-speaker audio system, and a driver information display. Optional features include an upgraded 8-inch touchscreen display and infotainment system, an eight-speaker Harman Kardon sound system, power moonroof, and a Wi-Fi hotspot.  \n\n### Safety & Driving Assistance  \n\nTLDR: The Crosstrek is one of the safest vehicles in its class.  \n\nSubarus are some of the safest vehicles on the road. The Crosstrek has the added availability of the EyeSight safety suite for 2019, giving it the upper hand against competitors with less safety equipment.  \n\nSubaru's EyeSight safety suite includes adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, lane-departure warning, automatic emergency pre-collision braking, and pre-collision warning.  \n\nStandard safety features include a rearview camera, traction control, stability control and advanced airbags.\n\nIn addition to its outstanding safety features, the Crosstrek has been awarded top crash-test ratings by both the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The NHTSA has awarded the Crosstrek with five out of five stars overall in its testing. IIHS rated it as a Top Safety Pick+ based on all of its safety categories.\n\n### Driving Experience \n\nTLDR: The Crosstrek is low in performance and handling, but handles itself better under usual driving conditions. \n\nThe Subaru Crosstrek driving experience represents a mixed bag to reviewers. Most agree the Crosstrek is pleasant to drive when not pushed to its limits. They also agree that performance is among the worst in the class and that the lack of engine and transmission refinement can be uncomfortable.  \n\nThe Subaru Crosstrek is available with one engine option as well as a hybrid powertrain.  \n\nA 2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine produces 152 horsepower and 145 lb.-ft. of torque. A six-speed manual transmission comes standard on the lowest trim models of the Crosstrek with an optional CVT automatic is standard on the highest Crosstrek trim, optional on others.  \n\nA Crosstrek plug-in hybrid is also available which utilizes the same engine but produces a slightly lower 148 horsepower in combination with two small electric motors.  \n\nThough reviewers praise the Crosstrek's road manners in most normal driving situations, they are underwhelmed by the power and responsiveness of the engine and transmission. The [Mazda CX-3](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-cx+3) has less horsepower than the Crosstrek, but reviewers agree that it is much more agile and responsive, making the [CX-3](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-cx+3) feel much faster than it is.  \n\nReviewers complain that the CVT has quite a bit of lag when the accelerator is pressed and that the Crosstrek struggles to get up to highway speeds when brief acceleration is necessary. Generally speaking, those times are limited, and the power is adequate for most normal circumstances according to reviewers.      \n\nZero-to-60 mph acceleration times come in at over 10 seconds, slower than most competitors. Braking fared better with reviewers noting that brake pedal feel is stable and consistent. Braking distances from 60 mph came in at 118 feet, according to testers, roughly the average for the segment.  \n\nThe Crosstrek's handling also falls behind the competition. The [CX-3](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-cx+3) sets the benchmark again, while the Crosstrek is rated by many reviewers as close to the bottom.  \n\nManeuverability makes up some lost points as reviewers note that the Crosstrek has a tight turning radius and easy-to-use steering in tight cornering situations. Most agree that normal city driving and reasonable off-road use are the best-suited areas for the Crosstrek.  \n\n### Fuel efficiency  \n\nTLDR: The Crosstrek returns average fuel economy, but the hybrid option is better for those who prioritize efficiency.\n\nFuel efficiency is considered by many reviewers to be a significant weakness of the Crosstrek, although a plug-in hybrid has remedied that somewhat.\n\nThe 2.0-liter engine is EPA-rated at 23 mpg city and 29 highway when combined with the six-speed manual. A combined 25 mpg rating is one of the lowest in the segment. Models equipped with the automatic transmission are rated at 27 mpg in the city and 33 on the highway, with a combined rating of 29.  \n\nThe [Mazda CX-3](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-cx+3), [Honda HR-V](https://www.autolist.com/honda-hr+v) and [Hyundai Kona](https://www.autolist.com/hyundai-kona) outshine the Crosstrek by returning combined estimates of 30 mpg or higher. The Jeep Renegade and Fiat 500X come closer to the manual Crosstrek's estimates, but both round out the bottom of the class in fuel efficiency.  \n\nThe Crosstrek Hybrid gains a much better rating for the class, returning a 35 mpg combined fuel efficiency rating. However, it only has an estimated 17 miles of electric-only range. State and federal incentives may be available for this version.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Trim Levels & Pricing \n\nTLDR: Crosstreks are well-equipped compared to their competition, but a top-of-the-line model can quickly become pricey. \n\nAll-wheel-drive is standard on all Subaru Crosstrek models.  \n\nThe base 2.0-liter engine is standard on all trim levels. A six-speed manual transmission is standard on the two lowest trim levels of the Crosstrek with a $1,000 CVT transmission option. The third and highest Crosstrek trim level comes only with a continuously variable transmission.  \n\nThe hybrid option costs an additional $7,800 over a similarly equipped Limited model. It also uses a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, with assist from an electric motor.\n\nThe 2019 Subaru Crosstrek is available in three different trim levels:  \n\n__Subaru Crosstrek 2.0i:__  \n\nThe base Crosstrek 2.0i starts at $22,870 with the destination fee included. A six-speed manual transmission is standard, and the CVT is a $1,000 upgrade.  \n\nStandard equipment on the 2.0i includes a Starlink infotainment system with a 6.5-inch touchscreen display, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, a four-speaker audio system, cloth upholstery, air conditioning, driver information display, and 17-inch alloy wheels.  \n\nOptions include Subaru's EyeSight safety suite which contains adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, automatic emergency braking, and forward pre-collision warning.  \n\n__Subaru Crosstrek 2.0i Premium: __\n\nThe Crosstrek 2.0i Premium starts at $23,870, and the CVT adds $1,000 to that.\n\nStandard features include everything from 2.0i including heated front seats, a six-speaker sound system, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, automatic headlights, fog lights, heated side mirrors, and additional Starlink Multimedia features.  \n\nOptions include an upgraded EyeSight system with blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert, satellite radio, and a power moonroof.  \n\n__Subaru Crosstrek 2.0i Limited:__  \n\nThe top-of-the-line Crosstrek 2.0i Limited carries an MSRP of $28,170.\n\nStandard equipment includes CVT transmission, an 8-inch touchscreen, onboard Wi-Fi, leather upholstery, power driver's seat, paddle shifters, automatic climate control, 18-inch alloy wheels, and steering-sensitive LED low and high beam headlights.  \n\nOptions include remote start, a six-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, and a power moonroof.  \n\nChoosing the Subaru Crosstrek hybrid costs $35,970 with the destination fee included.  \n\nHybrid models come comparably equipped to Limited models with a heated steering wheel, blue interior stitching rather than the standard orange stitching, X-mode driving mode, and an optional Rockford Fosgate stereo system.  \n\nFully loaded, the most expensive Subaru Crosstrek models will cost around $40,000.  \n### Value  \n\nTLDR: The Crosstrek offers a better than average value because of its capability, safety, and overall ability to do the most important things well.  \n\nThe 2019 Subaru Crosstrek presents potential buyers with a better than average value for a compact SUV.  \n\nAs noted by reviewers, performance is severely lacking compared to the competition. Acceleration comes in at the bottom of the class, and most reviewers agree that handling is not one of the Crosstrek's strong points.  \n\nThe fuel economy is average for the class. The hybrid option is much better, but it is also generally more expensive unless buyers opt for the top-of-the-line Limited models with all of the options.  \n\nCargo capacity, seating room, standard equipment, and comfort are all standard for the segment. The Crosstrek shines when it comes to safety, capability, and purported reliability.  \n\nIf agile handling and strong performance are musts, the Subaru Crosstrek will disappoint. It can hold its own in every other category and outshines many comparable subcompact SUVs with its superior safety and go-anywhere capability.  \n\nIt is priced slightly higher than some competitors, but it is not the most expensive vehicle in its class. It delivers what most reviewers see as crucial to potential buyers very well for the price. \n\n### More Photos\n\nSee more [2019 Subaru Crosstrek Photos](https://www.autolist.com/subaru-xv+crosstrek-2019/2019-subaru-crosstrek-photos).",

Or a new-to-you used car. Or truck. Or minivan. Or crossover. Whatever its shape, a new car is awesome. \n\nAnd it will be worth the time and energy you put into finding the perfect one, because you have us here to help. \n\nTo make sure that you not only love your new vehicle but that you feel good about how you found that vehicle and how much you paid for it, we’ve put together a step-by-step Buyers Guide that works for both new and used cars. \n\nFollow these easy steps, take deep breaths if you get stressed out and remember that this will be worth it! OK here … we … go. \n\n---\n\n## What’s it going to cost me?\n\n![shutterstock 1426286264 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4K2i3KpqNRq75JfPgsizHQ/21abac5c34892bccc910eb13e16813af/shutterstock_1426286264__1_.jpg)\n\nTo get an idea of what vehicle to look for, start by figuring out what you can afford. This is a good time to be honest with yourself about what you can and should spend on a new-to-you vehicle. \n\n__How much should I budget for a new car?__\nThere are a range of suggested budgets for what to spend on a car, so use these as rough guidelines.\n\nGenerally, financial experts recommend spending between 10 and 20 percent of your monthly income on your vehicle. Some say that should be pre-tax while others say to calculate your budget based on your actual monthly take-home pay. Others say to look for a vehicle that costs roughly half of your annual take-home pay.\n\nBut when calculating your budget for a new-to-you vehicle, remember to factor in two additional monthly costs that will likely change from your current vehicle: insurance and fuel. \n\n__Insurance__ \nInsurance will go up because your new vehicle is worth more than the one you’re replacing. Depending on your new vehicle, it could go up a lot. A general rule of thumb is, the faster, more rare and more exciting the car is to drive, the more it will cost to insure it. Thus, an entry-level Chrysler Pacifica minivan will cost considerably less to insure than a loaded Porsche 911 Turbo S. \n\nIt’s typically the high-end sports cars with big engines that cost the most to insure. Not only are these expensive in the first place, but statistically they’re more likely to be crashed. Sorry speed-hounds, but it’s true. \n\nRegardless of what you end up buying, expect it to come with a higher insurance bill than you’re paying now.  \n\n__Your fuel costs could also change.__ \nAs we mention below, the EPA has a handy free tool here that allows you to look up the fuel economy of any car going back to 1984. Use this to compare your old car to your new one, or several new models that you’re considering to each other. \n\n__How do you pay for a new car?__\nSadly cars aren’t free. You need to pay for them, and since they’re likely the second-most expensive thing you’ll buy (homes are No.1), you will need help finding the money. \n\nYou have two options: leasing or buying. Regardless of its source, we strongly recommend having your financing worked out before you step foot in a dealership. Sometimes a dealer can offer you better financing terms than anywhere else, but you’ll often get better rates elsewhere. If you walk into a dealership and you have the financing already done, you can then compare it to what the dealer is offering.\n\n__Buying and Financing__\nIf you’re buying the car, you will need to finance the purchase. \n\nDepending on the model or the time of year, the automaker itself (not the dealer) may offer great financing terms like interest rates between 0% — basically free money — and 1.9%. That’s a smart option. \n\nYou can also check out car loans at your bank or credit union that may have better interest rates than a bank. \n\nGetting pre-approved for a loan could also be a good idea so you know what you can afford. \n\nRemember that when you’re trying to figure out how much to spend for a down payment, most experts say it’s smart to budget between 10 and 20 percent of the vehicle’s cost. \n\nBut no matter where you get your loan, be smart about its length. The average price of new vehicles has never been higher (currently around $33,000) but to afford that, more consumers are signing up for 72- to 96-month loans. \n\nThis can end up costing a lot in interest, and it likely means you will owe more on the car than it is worth for the duration of the loan. That could come back to bite you if the car is totaled or if you’re forced to sell it for an unforeseen reason. It also means your car will be old by the time it’s paid off. \n\n__Leasing__\nIf you really want a car that is more expensive and would stretch you into a long loan, consider leasing. This gets you more car for your monthly payment, and most leases are 24 to 36 months long so you’re not stuck with a car for a long period of time. \n\nThis is also useful if you expect your car needs to change in two or  three years. Perhaps you’ll be moving to another city in that time, or you plan to have kids, or your kids will be moving out.\n\nThe downside to leasing is that you don’t build equity in the vehicle as you would if you had bought it. It’s the same as renting a house versus buying a house; every rent check you write you will never see again.\n\nLeases also limit the number of miles you can drive annually and charge you for every mile you’re over the limit (though you can negotiate this at the beginning of the lease if you’re sure you’ll go over.\n\n__When is the best time to buy?__\nThere are good times during the calendar year to buy a car and not-so-good times. Not everyone has control over when they have to go car shopping again: your old car kicks the bucket, it’s totaled or your lease is up. \n\nBut if you can control when you shop, here are some times throughout the year when you’ll have better luck getting a deal on a new or used car from a dealer (buying private is generally the same all year).\n\n- __At the end of the model year.__ This falls around August and September. It’s when the current model year vehicles are on their way out and dealers are starting to get next year’s models. This is when dealers and the automakers themselves are feeling pressure to get rid of the older models while they can. \n\n- __At the end of the calendar year.__ We’ve all seen the commercials during the holidays: a husband or wife leads their spouse outside to a snowy driveway where a new car sits with a big red bow on it. While that scenario may be far-fetched, the notion of getting a new car at this time isn’t. At the end of the calendar year dealers and automakers are keen to get rid of everything they can to have as good a sales year as possible. And those 2018 models that weren’t snatched up in August and September are really making dealers nervous; as soon as the new year hits the cars will be old, and no dealer wants to be stuck with them then.  \n\n- __Black Friday and three-day holidays weekends.__ Again with the ads … we’ve all seen dealers screaming on TV about all the deals they’re having for _INSERT HOLIDAY HERE_. But there’s truth to what they’re saying; they wouldn’t be spending money on the ads in the first place if they didn’t want to sell some cars. Automakers get into this too and often offer low financing deals or lease specials. \n\n- __Not a good time? Springtime isn’t when you want to be buying a car.__ Many people have tax refund checks they’re looking to spend, and dealers and automakers know this so they’re less willing to cut deals. Plus, the spring is in between several big holidays like Presidents Day and then Memorial Day that are traditionally good deal-making times. \n\n---\n\n![Buyers Guide Search](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1zALqhwlgbcS8kT1TwjAtg/e03761b5bf9d205f4b0893020948a5c2/Buyers_Guide_Search.jpg)\n\n## What do you want?\nBefore you even walk into a dealership, do some thinking — and some online research — about what you want. The floor of the dealership is not the place to start making up your mind in terms of vehicle type, your budget, must-have features, color, brand or model. \n\nTo start, think about how you’re going to use the vehicle. \n\nNot how you might use it but how, on a daily basis, you will actually use it. Because we have big, open roads and relatively cheap gas, Americans are used to getting the biggest, most-capable vehicle possible. \n\nMany people assume they need a vehicle that will meet every need that they might encounter in the five years they own it. “I’ll go skiing twice in five years so I definitely need all-wheel-drive” doesn’t make sense for the other 1,821 days that you own the vehicle if you’re driving in Los Angeles. \n\nAlso think about how long you plan on owning this vehicle. How might your life change in that time? This isn’t the time to buy a sexy two-door coupe if you plan on having a baby soon. \n\nIf you’re honest with yourself now about how you will use the vehicle, you will save yourself the time, money and hassle of needing to buy another car in the future. \n\nIt’s also good to ask around and see what your friends and family like. Not necessarily for specific brand or model — though that’s certainly helpful — but ask what type of vehicle they have and see whether it would fit your lifestyle. \n\n__New vs Used vs Certified Pre-Owned__\nFor every person who says new cars lose a chunk of their value the minute they leave the lot, there’s another person who says that when you buy a used car, you’re just buying someone else’s problems. \n\nSo who’s right?\n\nAs you’d imagine, there are pros and cons to each case. Hear us out:\n\n__When to buy a new car - the main benefits__\n- __The latest safety and technology.__ Tech inside cars today is advancing as rapidly as it is on your smartphone. So if you want the latest in safety and/or tech like low-level autonomous vehicles with adaptive cruise control, pedestrian detection, automated self-parking or connectivity to your phone, new cars will offer what used cars — even those that are a few years old — can’t match. \n\n- __It’s easier and less stressful.__ A new car obviously hasn’t had any prior owners that you need to worry about. The warranty is new on the car, you don’t need to have it checked out by a third- party or worry that it’s been abused in its past life, even if it looks and drives fine. \n\n- __Style.__ Automakers deliberately change the styling and features of all their vehicles every few years. Some of this is because there have been genuine advancements in safety, efficiency, comfort and technology. But some is pure vanity; they know there are plenty of people who like knowing that they have the latest version of any given vehicle. This is a key reason some people only consider new vehicles; they just want the latest.\n\n- __They’re more efficient.__ No car gets more efficient as it gets older. So if you’re really concerned with the efficiency of a vehicle, buying something new ensures that you’re getting the greenest and cleanest vehicle possible. \n\n- __It’s easier to pay for.__ Whether leasing or buying, it’s generally easier to get loans for a new car than it is a used car. Many banks won’t even offer car loans on cars that are above a certain age. And new car dealers and automakers themselves often have great lease deals or low financing offers on new cars to lure shoppers away from the used lot and toward the new lot. \n\n__When to buy a used car - the main benefits__\n- __It’s a smarter financial decision.__ There’s still no getting around the fact that it makes better financial sense to buy used versus new. Used buyers aren’t hit with the depreciation every new car instantly faces when it’s driven off the lot. Insurance is cheaper too if the car costs less to repair or replace. \n\n- __More car for your $.__ Let’s say you have a budget of $30,000 for a vehicle and you want a compact crossover. That could buy you a nicely-equipped brand new Honda CR-V. Or you could go the used route and get a 2-year-old Acura RDX with 20,000 miles on it for the same price. More luxury for the same money! Or you could get a used Honda Pilot (the next size up from the CR-V) for the same money. More size for the same money! \n\n- __Reliability isn’t an issue like it used to be.__ Buying a new car is no longer the only way to make sure you’re getting a trouble-free car. Yes, maintenance is still important on any car, but a car with 50,000 miles on it today still has plenty of trouble-free mileage ahead of it. \n\n__Other resources__\nSo you’ve figured out your budget, how you’re going to pay for it and how you feel about new versus used. Now some research on the vehicles themselves. Here are some common areas that are important to people and where to find the info you’re looking for. \n\n__Reliability__\n- __JD Power:__ JD Power tracks car owners’ satisfaction and vehicle dependability and comes out with multiple surveys each year that rank the reliability and quality of automakers and specific models. This can give you an excellent idea of how people feel about their cars and brands and the troubles they’ve encountered.\n\n- __Consumer Reports:__ In addition to reviewing new cars like we at Autolist do, Consumer Reports also closely tracks the reliability of vehicles via a survey sent to thousands of its readers. Like the JD Power survey, this is an excellent way to look up the reliability of used vehicles, sourced directly from car owners like yourself. \n\n- __CarFax:__ Once you’re ready to buy a specific used car, use CarFax to check that vehicle’s specific history. This is a critical step to knowing the full backstory about the car you’re interested in. A CarFax report will show its full history for maintenance, accidents and repairs as well as odometer verification, recall status and even if the airbags have been deployed. To use this site, you’ll need the vehicle’s vehicle identification number (usually 17-digits long and found where the windshield and the dashboard meet in front of the driver), so if a seller refuses to give it to you after you’ve made it clear that you intend to buy the vehicle, that could be a red flag. \n\n__Safety__\n- __Crash tests and safety ratings:__ There are two great (and free!) sources for crash-test info and unbiased safety ratings on nearly every car on the market. They are the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). \n\n- __Recalls:__ Check for open recalls on a model you’re interested in on [NHTSA’s site here](https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls). You can also use this site to search for a specific vehicle if you have its VIN. \n\n__Fuel economy__\n- __fueleconomy.gov__ has the EPA ratings for almost any vehicle you’ll want to look up — new or used. You can compare various models and model years too. The site often compares these official ratings and estimates to what owners of that specific model are getting. \n\n  Just because a vehicle is rated at a certain fuel economy (say 24 mpg in the city and 31 on the highway), doesn’t mean you will actually see those figures. Automakers test their vehicles’ fuel economy in a controlled lab that isn’t as accurate in the real world as you might think. \n\n  Plus, with the rise of turbocharged engines across the industry, it’s becoming more common for a vehicle with that engine type to get lower fuel economy in the real world, which makes the user-submitted info particularly helpful. This is because automakers know that turbocharged engines are efficient in the lab tests but less so when real people are driving them in the real world.\n\n__So what’s good fuel economy?__ \nThe EPA says the average fuel economy in a 2018 vehicle is 27 mpg combined. \n\nSo if you’re looking at a smaller, non-hybrid car, you should expect something quite a bit higher  — like above 40 mpg combined. \n\nHybrid cars like the Toyota Prius can easily surpass 50 mpg combined. \n\nMidsize sedans and crossovers should be in the high 20s to mid 30s for combined mileage.\n\nLarger crossovers and minivans will have combined fuel economy averages in the low to mid 20s. \n\nIf you’re looking at an electric vehicle or a plug-in hybrid vehicle (which is a gas engine and an electric motor), you’ll notice that the EPA has a new MPGe rating. What this actually means can be confusing to the average consumer, though it can be helpful in comparing one plug-in hybrid’s efficiency to another. \n\nBut generally if you’re looking at a plug-in hybrid vehicle or an electric vehicle, you’re going to want to know its all-electric range, or the time it takes to recharge a dead battery on a 240v outlet (like the one your dryer uses) and how many miles of range you can get on a quick 30-minute fast charge. \n\n---\n\n## Drive & Don’t Drive:\n![shutterstock 765129619 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4DNwsvDDxBMnG8R2KreeqA/813f78609299087b39d33c61f6253163/shutterstock_765129619__1_.jpg)\n\n\nOK, you’ve done your homework, now comes the fun part: driving what you like! \n\n__Finding a dealer__\nUse a site like Yelp or Google or an automaker’s own website to see where the dealerships are in your area. Check the online reviews of them, but as with any online review, take everything (good and bad) with a grain of salt. Also, ask around among friends, family and coworkers to see who had a good experience at which dealership or salesperson. \n\nThe advantage of larger dealerships is they have more inventory and therefore a better chance of having the exact model, color and trim that you’re looking for. \n\nLarger dealerships can also offer better deals (sometimes) since they’re more easily hitting sales targets set by automakers that generate bonuses for the dealership and the sales people. \n\nLarger stores are also paying less in overhead (per vehicle), savings that theoretically they can pass on to the customer. \n\nFinally, larger stores can also offer better interest rates from banks because of their size.\n\nBut smaller stores can often offer personalized attention which can be important if you’re living in that area for a while and there’s a good chance you’d return to that dealership in the future for your next car. \n\nAlso remember that while you shouldn’t go to the dealership for out-of-pocket oil changes (since a place like JiffyLube or Valvoline will do it cheaper), you will need to go to the dealership for any warranty repairs or service intervals. So keep this in mind if you buy from a dealership that’s any distance from your home or office. \n\nYou don’t need to set up an appointment to test drive a vehicle, though it can be a good way to set up a relationship with a salesperson rather than just working with whomever is available when you show up. \n\n__The test drive:__ \nUseful seat time in the car is absolutely critical. So if the person selling the vehicle or the salesperson won’t let you drive it on a meaningful test drive on public roads (20-30 minutes at least), walk away. You’re about to spend tens of thousands of dollars on this vehicle so it’s reasonable to expect some seat time in it first. \n\nIt also might be the first new (to you) car that you’ve driven in a while. So the first one you get in could feel amazing just because it’s newer. But be sure to drive competing models to really get a sense of what to expect. The worst new car on the market could still drive better than what you’re used to, but that doesn’t mean it’s worth buying. \n\nBecause there’s a lot you’ll want to learn about that car, break it into two parts: drive it to see if you like how it is on the road, then park it to check out its other features. \n\n__Drive__\n- __Drive on surface streets.__ Drive it like you normally drive your current car. Stop, go, change lanes, merge; get a feel for the vehicle at lower speeds. Aim for a rough road or a bump or pothole to see if there are any significant vibrations or rattles that are a concern. Accelerate and brake hard to see what it feels like (maybe warn the salesperson first). \n\n- __Drive on a highway, freeway or street where you can safely hit freeway speeds.__ Not only does this give you a sense of how the car handles at speed, but it can also reveal wobbles, rattles and noises that you might miss at low speeds. Use this time to check your blind spots too as you change lanes. Again, accelerate on the onramp to see how the car feels. \n\n- __Park it__. Is there a backup camera, parking sensors, a huge blindspot that causes you to bump into a tree or hop a curb? Parallel park the car and turn it around in a K-turn at least once to see what this feels like. Maneuver in and out of a tight parking lot … you’ll be doing this a lot once you own it. \n\n__Don’t drive__ \nAlmost as important as how the vehicle drives is how it does all of the other things beyond driving. Some new cars today are getting poor reviews from their owners because they only discover they hate the seats or stereo controls after they’ve bought the car. \n\nSo once you’re parked, insist on sitting in the driver’s seat and the rear seats and spend 10-20 minutes going over the following things. If these present red flags or they just don’t make you feel comfortable with the car, reconsider.\n\n- How do you connect your phone? \n- How do you make a phone call? \n- How do you put a destination into the navigation system?\n- Is the nav system more useful than the one on your phone or can you save some money and buy one without paying extra for nav?\n- How do you find your favorite radio station on the stereo or song on your phone?\n- Some new cars are using touch-sensitive buttons or touchpads for things like stereo volume. How easy is it to use these features?\n- How do you configure the infotainment system in the dashboard to your preferences?\n- How do you set up the screen (if there is one) in the instrument panel?\n- Is there an easy place to put stuff like a purse, drinks, laptop, sunglasses and phone?\n- Are the seats comfortable?\n- How easy is it to adjust them?\n- Is there enough room in the rear seats for what you’ll need (don’t forget to actually sit back there...we at Autolist do it for every vehicle we review, despite some odd looks from our neighbors).\n- Do the rear seats fold down? If so, where is that lever … in the trunk or behind the seats?\n- On minivans and crossovers with three rows of seats: how do the middle seats fold completely flat and move out of the way? What about the third row of seats? Are the seats removable?\n- How easy is it to put in (and take out) a child’s seat?\n- Where is the trunk release and gas door release?\n- Does the car have a spare tire? Where is it (under the car, under the trunk floor)? If it doesn’t, does it have a patch kit?\n- Are there USB ports to charge your phone? Where?\n- How do the headlights turn on/off? Is there an automatic feature?\n- How do the windshield wipers work? \n- How do you adjust the mirrors?\n\n\n__Done driving__\nAfter you’re done test-driving (and test not-driving), get a quote from your dealer. Make sure that price is specific to that exact model and VIN that you want and that it’s the total price that includes all taxes and fees. __Get it in writing with all of these details.__ \n\nTell them you’re looking for their final, take-it-or-leave-it offer that’s exactly what it will cost you to get out the door, and that you’ll be shopping it around.  \n\nGet the salesperson’s contact info and thank them for their time — remember, most dealers are honest, hardworking salespeople trying to earn a living. The smart ones will realize you’re a savvy buyer who’s done your homework and they’ll be direct about what price they can and can’t accept for a vehicle. \n\nFinally, no matter how good their offer might seem, __take it home and sleep on it.__\n\nIf you have the time, you can visit other dealerships to continue test-driving, especially if you want to compare brands. \n\nBut if you’ve found the model, trim and features that you like, the rest of the negotiations can and should be done from home. \n\n---\n## Time to drive a bargain \n![Buyers Guide Negotiation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4Sf0PkdxXLog669oJoz0Sl/2e2a889cd921149572e6faaefb89506f/Buyers_Guide_Negotiation.jpg)\n\nThis is the part of car-buying that people hate the most: You want to make sure you’re getting a good deal and that you’re not being taken advantage of, but it’s also uncomfortable asking for what you want from the seller or dealer. We get it! \n\nJust remember: at the end of all this, you’ll have a new vehicle. That’s awesome. Fortunately, you’re also smart so you know three secrets other buyers forget:\n\n- The seller *wants* to sell the vehicle. You have the power in this situation to walk away at any point.\n- Be confident! You’re doing your research so you know not only the vehicle you want but what you should pay for that vehicle. Just make sure you get to this decision on your own time, without the pressure of the seller or salesperson. \n- This isn’t the only vehicle for sale on the planet. In fact, there are likely thousands just like it. So if you aren’t able to get your fair price for this specific one, you’ll find another just like it for your price someplace else. \n\n__Gathering competing offers__\nNow that you know what you want, you can gather competing offers from dealers. Call or email the sales manager and tell them the exact model and trim level you’re looking for and that you have an offer for it at the real price the original dealer quoted you. See if they can beat it. \n\nWhen comparison shopping for offers from dealers in your area, there are a few things to keep in mind. \n\n- The offer is for a specific vehicle that a dealer currently has in stock.\n- The offer is for the same brand and model with the same trim level, mileage and model year as the vehicle you originally found. (Sometimes automakers make significant changes to the engine or transmission from one year to the next but the interior and exterior of the vehicle look the same as it did before. So do your research if you get a quote for a different model year). And different trim levels on the same model of car can add thousands of dollars to the price, so make sure you’re getting quotes for the same trim level (a Honda Accord LX may look the same as a Honda Accord EX-L 2.0, but the LX will cost many thousands of dollars less). \n\t\n- The competing offer should include all taxes and fees, just like your original offer, so it’s an apples-to-apples comparison.  \n\n- None of the offers — your original, online or comparison offer — depends on you adding additional items like extra warranties, tire or paint protection, sealant, underbody coating or aftermarket accessories like floor mats or alarm systems. You don’t need any of these items, so smile and politely decline them, no matter what horror stories you may hear.\n\n__Negotiating__\nAfter you’ve gathered your various offers, now you can negotiate. Whether it’s with the first dealer you visited or the last or a dealer you didn’t even visit but who has the model you’re looking for, now you have a sense of what kind of car you want, what you can afford and roughly what it’s going to cost you. Now it’s time to bargain. \n\nHere are some tips to remember:\n\n- Remember that the MSRP on the car’s window sticker is generally not a useful starting point for negotiating a price. Instead, use the dealer invoice as a starting point. Aim to spend that amount or a little more.  \n\n- Some dealers will use a “dealer invoice” price as the lowest they can go and you might even hear, “I’ll lose money if I go lower.” Remember that that’s almost never the case; dealerships and salespeople get bonuses and allowances from the automakers for every car they sell, so even if it looks like they’re losing money selling the car to you for a certain price, they’re not. \n\n- While you may know your target monthly payment, don’t tell the dealer what it is, negotiate the car’s entire price instead. If you negotiate for a monthly payment with the dealer, sometimes they will play around with your trade-in value or your financing terms to get you a monthly payment that looks good but makes you pay more interest over a longer loan term. \n\n- Be reasonable; when negotiating a deal between multiple sellers, don’t expect a $1,000 difference on a $15,000 car. If there’s that big of a gap, the two models aren’t the same.\n\n- Be ready to walk away. Remember that you likely have more than one option of where to buy a car, so don’t forget that if you’re not comfortable with the deal, you can always walk away. You could very well hear back from that dealer a day or two later and suddenly they’re able to make the deal you want. \n\n- Let the dealer do the talking. You’re not obligated to share any info with them that you don’t want to (including your Social Security number). Focus on negotiating just the price of the new car and don’t bring up monthly payments, your trade-in value or where you’re financing. By focusing just on the car’s price, it prevents the dealer from trying to make up more profit elsewhere in the negotiations. State your price and let the dealer fill the void … they often will.\n\n- Some fees and taxes can’t be negotiated. Sales tax, delivery fees and licensing fees are all beyond the dealer’s control, so don’t beat them up over it. However, some dealers will try to tack on fees like marketing, documentation or general dealer fees. Keep an eye out for these. \n\n__Warranty?__\nOn new cars, just say no and avoid the temptation of paying additional money for an extended warranty. New cars today are not only well-built but they also come with a healthy warranty from the automaker that should cover any problems you might have with the car. \n\nIf you’re buying used, it’s a little more murky. Consumer Reports surveyed users and found that only half of the people who bought a used-car warranty actually used it in the past five years. And those that did use it ended up spending more on the warranty than they would have on the repairs that it covered. \n\nThus, it’s often better to pass up the warranty and instead set aside a little money in case of a repair. Particularly if the warranty has a deductible of any kind. \n\nRead our Reliability section earlier in this guide to see how the car you’re interested in stacks up. If it’s an unreliable model or if the peace of mind that comes with a warranty is worth the money to you, then it might be a good idea. \n\n__Final offer__\nOnce you have a final offer that you’re happy with, get everything in writing, including that the price does or does not include additional items and warranties. Again, make sure it’s for the specific car you want … with its actual VIN. \n\n---\n\n\n## Getting your new car!\nNow that you have an offer that you feel is reasonable  —  whether it’s from a competing dealer or your original seller — you’re ready to close the deal. \n\nThese days, much of the paperwork can either be done online or the dealer can email it to you. Try to get as much of the deal done from the comfort of your own home so that all that’s left to do at the dealership is sign. \n\nLook over the final offer to make sure it’s what you were expecting, including the pricing details again, the warranty details (is it transferable, what does it cover and what’s the deductible) and any financing agreements like loan length or interest rate. \n\nOnce you’re ready to sign, set up an appointment to come into the dealership (or sometimes the dealership will deliver the car to you with the final paperwork to sign). \n\n## Go drive!\n![Buyers Guide End](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6z0DqyNWuqPDfNbgRPlE88/7b0c95e521391c0ae9295a89b6cacade/Buyers_Guide_End.jpg)\n\n\n",

      "body": "Trading in your vehicle to a dealership is a good way to help fund the purchase of a new car. But what if a car has mechanical problems, such as a blown engine or gasket leak? If you make the right preparations, you can still trade in the vehicle.\n\n### Why Should You Trade in Your Car?\n\nMost car dealers allow trade-ins. That is, they purchase your current vehicle to help cover the cost of a new one you want to buy. Trade-ins are especially helpful for people who need a new vehicle but can't afford to advertise their old one or meet with prospective car buyers. The trade-in value of a car is typically its market value, such as you might find through Edmunds or Kelley Blue Book. The amount will also depend on the type and year of the car, as well as popularity and condition. Trade-ins are a great way to get an old car off your hands, and they sometimes cover the entire down payment of a new car purchase. Trade-ins can also lower the amount you must pay each month if you take out a car loan.\n\n### Trading in a Car With Problems: How It Works\n\nWhen you arrange to trade in a car, the dealer usually inspects it for damage and deducts the cost of any necessary repairs from the value of your vehicle. Be upfront about your car's problems when trading it in because dealers sometimes make less generous offers if they discover problems on their own. If your vehicle has significant collision damage, such as a destroyed fender or missing bumper, a dealer is unlikely to accept the vehicle in trade. However, most mechanical problems are negotiable, such as rusted exhaust systems, worn suspension components and wheel bearings and oil leaks. If your car has electrical issues, such as faulty door locks or a battery that dies at random, the dealer may not accept the vehicle depending on the severity of the problem. Also, minor body damage such as a fender bender is rarely a deal-breaker. Dealers like to recondition cars they get through trade-ins, even when the vehicles are well-maintained.\n\nIt's best to get a vehicle with problems appraised before stepping onto the dealership's lot. Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book and the National Automobile Dealers Association feature online appraisal tools to make evaluating your car easier. The tools let you include the car's condition for a more accurate figure. However, dealers typically have their own estimates of the cost of repairs, and these may differ from yours. Dealers are also required by law to fix critical problems with cars they plan to resell, so expect your car dealership to deduct the cost of these repairs from the car's trade-in value. These include any issues that would prevent the vehicle from passing a smog test or state inspection.\n\nIn some cases, the dealer buying the vehicle may already be planning to sell it to a wholesaler. They buy cars from dealers to sell them to other dealers or at car auctions, and they don't always care if the cars they buy have problems. Even if your vehicle has significant damage, you might be able to trade it in anyway.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Preparing Your Car for a Trade-In\n\nHow much work you should put into your car before trading it depends on how bad the vehicle's problems are. If the vehicle has a big problem, such as a blown engine or bad transmission, it most likely needs repairs that are more expensive than what the vehicle is worth as a trade-in. Small problems, on the other hand, are worth fixing. If your car is dirty, you should hand-wash and wax it before bringing it to the dealer. Use carwash product instead of household cleaners, and scrub the vehicle with a carwash sponge instead of a cloth or washing mitt to ensure the car is properly cleaned. When waxing, both carnauba-based and synthetic polymer-based waxes can give the vehicle an attractive shine, but the polymer-based stuff is easier to apply. Also, you should remove any junk inside your car. For an extra touch, consider taking the car to a detailer to shampoo the carpets, remove bad odors, and give the glass a deep clean. Remember to keep your car's maintenance records in the glove box and remove all other papers.\n\nAlso, you should top up all your vehicle's fluids, such as the oil, brake and transmission fluids. Dealers usually top up these fluids when they buy a car, but low fluid levels may make dealers suspect problems with the vehicle. If the Check Engine light is on, the vehicle will need to be inspected by a mechanic to determine the cause of that warning. Remember to replace any burned-out bulbs, including those for any interior lights. \n\nIf the headlights and taillights are foggy, the lenses may need buffing. Rub whitening toothpaste on the lenses with a cloth, then rinse off the toothpaste with water. It's also a good idea to replace your windshield wipers if they're old or cracked. Windshield wipers are cheap, and auto stores typically help customers install them if they can't do so themselves. Also, if any of the exterior glass is cracked, your insurance may give you a new one for free. You might also want to remove any scratches on your vehicle with touch-up paint, which only costs a few dollars at most auto shops. Wet-sanding the car can also enhance the paintwork. Don't get too carried away with detailing, though, as dealerships can detail vehicles much more cheaply than car buyers can. Also, removing too much dirt from your car can reveal subpar paintwork that's better left hidden.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Other Considerations\n\nWhen trading in a car with problems, there are other factors to consider. For example, it's helpful to have multiple dealers appraise your vehicle before trading it in. That way, you have a better sense of the vehicle's worth. You also have negotiating leverage if one appraiser thinks your car's value is higher than another. Remember to visit dealers that sell your car new. These dealers are less likely to lowball you, as they know your car's actual value. \n\nNot all dealers offer free appraisals, but some do, such CarMax, which gives car buyers a free written estimate and seven days to accept it. When trading in your car, you might want to provide a vehicle history report to the dealer, as this builds trust. If the vehicle has had prior owners, a vehicle history report can also reveal problems with the car you may not have known before.\n\nEven if your car has problems, trading the vehicle in has many advantages over selling it to a private buyer. Depending on the value of your trade, a trade-in may eliminate the down payment on a new car. Also, you don't need to make a Craigslist ad for a vehicle you want to trade in. Dealers are also more accepting of problems than private buyers since they can sell damaged cars to wholesalers. Finally, dealers can handle all the sales paperwork for a hassle-free transfer. Trading in a vehicle with problems is a good way to get it off your hands while helping to fund the purchase of a new vehicle.",

      "body": "Buying a used vehicle instead of a new one is often a good way to save money and get more car for less money. However, if you're in the market for an older car, you're probably wondering how many miles is too many. \n\nIt's possible you'll find your perfect used car for exactly what you're willing to pay only to realize it has tens or even hundreds of thousands of miles on it. \n\nShould you walk away? Is a vehicle with 100,000 miles automatically on its last legs? \n\nHere's a look at just how many miles are too many when it comes to used cars.\n\n__General Guidelines__\n\nWhen you look at two cars and everything else is equal, except one has 50,000 miles and the other has 150,000 miles, it seems reasonable to assume the low mileage vehicle is worth more and is ultimately more desirable to purchase. \n\nAre fewer miles enough to tip the scales in that vehicle's favor? Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple. Not all miles are equal. For example, a vehicle with 100,000 miles that are almost all from highway driving by a commuter might be in better shape overall than the same vehicle with 50,000 miles that was a former rental car in a city and likely driven hard.\n\nOr perhaps a 70,000-mile car with five owners and incomplete service record is the same price as one with 100,000 miles, a single owner and all of its service records. The latter might be the better buy. \n\nOne rule of thumb to keep in mind, especially when looking at reports like Carfax or AutoCheck, is that 15,000 miles per year is considered to be the industry average. Therefore, if you're looking at a vehicle that is ten years old, it's not unreasonable for it to have 100,000 to 150,000 miles on it. If it has a lot more or a lot less, then you might want to do further investigation on why.\n\n__Good Condition and Maintenance Records__\n\nMileage isn't the only thing to take into account when looking at a used car. The overall condition of the vehicle and service records are also invaluable indicators on whether a car is a good buy or not. \n\nStart with the condition of a vehicle. A car that was well taken care of should show it in both the interior and the exterior. Badly maintained interiors and exteriors might indicate that the owner didn't put a lot of effort into keeping the vehicle in good shape. \n\nOn the other hand, carefully maintained interiors and exteriors might show that the owner was dedicated to keeping the car in good shape and also performed regular maintenance. This type of owner might also keep more thorough maintenance records showing service intervals from oil changes to brake jobs. \n\nOne smart habit when you're used car shopping is to research the service intervals for your chosen model to find out what typically needs to be done at certain mileage levels. You can use these as a checklist when you talk to the owner and look over maintenance records.\n\n__How Many Miles Are Left?__\n\nAnother way to look at the high mileage problem is to ask how many miles are left on the vehicle rather than how many miles it currently has. For example, if you're looking at a 100,000-mile vehicle in good condition from a brand whose vehicles often pass the 200,000-mile mark, then you could have as many as 100,000 miles left on that vehicle. If you only drive 10,000 miles per year, that could mean that you have 10 years left to use that vehicle. In that sense, it looks like a pretty good buy. \n\nEven if the average lifespan of the vehicle is 160,000 miles in this scenario, that's still six years if your average driving yields 10,000 miles per year.\n\n__Not All High Mileage Vehicles Are Equal__\n\nIn the end, some auto brands are more well-known than others for holding their value even with a high number of miles. Toyota and Honda are two of those brands. You can generally assume that a Toyota or Honda with over 100,000 miles on it is going to be worth more than most other vehicles with that same amount of miles. \n\nFor example, Toyota still has plenty of Tacoma trucks, 4Runner SUVs and Camry sedans on the road with over 100,000 miles and many over 200,000 miles. Toyota enthusiasts will tell you that 100,000 miles is just getting started. \n\nSimilarly, the Honda Civic and Accord still boast plenty of examples still on the road with high mileage. \n\n### Used Car Shopping Tips\n\nUltimately, you can't always take mileage on a used vehicle at face value. There are far too many additional factors to consider than simply the number on the odometer. Following are some crucial tips when shopping for a used car:\n\n- You'll likely get more information and a better deal if you buy from a private party, especially if you have cash.\n\n- Always look for as many flaws as possible and use them as negotiating points, especially with dealers.\n\n- Look into the car's history. Ask questions and try to obtain service records or receipts. Check for recalls on sites like Mopar and get a vehicle history report from a site like CarFax or AutoCheck if you're seriously interested in a certain car, as these will show how many owners the vehicle has had and likely a paper trail of maintenance and repair records.\n\n- Make sure to thoroughly research the make and model before shopping, so you know what kind of issues to look for and what services should have been done on it at certain mileages.\n\n- Get the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before you consider purchasing it.\n\n- If you're concerned about high mileage, research your chosen vehicle and find out how many miles you can expect to get if it's well-maintained. Further, ask the owner what kind of miles were put on the vehicle, i.e. city or highway miles.",

      "body": "Selling a car is a tedious enough process; if the vehicle you're trying to sell still has a loan against it, you have the makings of a potential headache. Don't worry, though. It's still possible to sell your financed car, but you'll need to jump through a few hoops to accomplish your objective and make sure the sale is above board and legal. \n\nWhen you take out a car loan, the lender holds the title to the vehicle until you pay it off. You may receive a certificate of title on the vehicle, but it will have an indication somewhere on the title of the lienholder. A \"clear\" title is one that has no lienholder or other encumbrances, and this is what you need to sell a financed car or use the car as a trade-in on a new car.\n\nLet's look at what you need to do to make this transaction happen. The steps for selling a car that's still financed differ, depending on whether you're selling your vehicle to a third-party or taking it to the dealership to exchange it for a newer model, which is mainly selling your car to the dealer. \n\n### Determining Your Car's Payoff Amount\n\nNo matter who's buying your car, your first order of business should be to find out how much you owe on your car loan. This figure is known as the payoff amount. You need to know this figure to pay off the remaining balance on the loan before transferring the title to its new owner. To get this figure, you will need to call your lender or check your account online, if you have that option.  \n\nKeep in mind that the payoff amount may end up being more or less than the total amount of your remaining loan balance. Some lenders penalize borrowers who pay off their car loans early; if this is the case, your payoff amount will be more than the total sum of the payments you have left on the loan once penalties and fees are tacked on. Other lenders reward borrowers who pay them early by reducing the amount owed by the interest that is tacked on to the loan's balance. That varies widely from lender to lender, so check with your specific lender to find out if they plan to penalize you for an early payoff.\n\n### Selling to a Private Buyer\n\nYour buyer will want an unencumbered car title, and a clear title is necessary before you can make the title transfer. In most instances, the buyer will pay you, you will pay the lender the payoff amount, and you'll pocket the rest. \n\nIf your loan is at a local bank, you can meet at the lender's location, accept the funds from the buyer at the location, and then sign the title over to the buyer from there. \n\nBecause it can take several weeks for the title to arrive after you have made the sale, your buyer may feel more comfortable paying the lender directly, since they will be buying a car for which the title is not available yet. That takes some trust on the part of the buyer, and may not be legal in your area, so check with the DMV to make sure you can proceed with the sale. Be sure to document everything, which protects both you and your buyer, before handing over the keys.\n\nOnce you know the payoff amount, you need to inquire with your lender about the documentation that they need from you to complete your auto loan and clear the title. Check with the local motor vehicle authority or Department of Motor Vehicles to determine what type of paperwork they need you to complete for you to sell the vehicle once you have clearance from your lender. \n\nIn some states, you may need to provide your buyer with a bill of sale that details the car's sale price and a liability release that releases you from any liability that may occur with the vehicle if something happens after you transfer the title. These should be filed with the DMV if required. Consult with your local DMV to determine the exact requirements in your specific location.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Auto Loan Assumption\n\nAnother option is to allow another person to \"take over\" your auto loan. In a typical auto loan assumption, the seller asks for a specific amount to enable the buyer to assume the loan; for example, the buyer pays you $3,000 and takes over the loan. \n\nBut that is not an option with all lenders, but many do offer loan assumptions. The buyer will need to be approved for the remaining payoff on your loan to make this type of arrangement work. \n\nFrom the buyer's standpoint, an auto assumption works much like a new auto loan. The lender will pull the potential buyer credit report and get their credit score. The buyer will need to go through the application process as usual. That means providing information on income for the lender to judge the buyer's ability to pay the loan. The lender will draw up a loan agreement, and ownership of the car will be transferred to the buyer. \n\nKeep in mind that if you allow someone to take over the payments on your car, it must be done legally (which protects your interests). Letting someone take over your auto loan absent approval by your lender may lead to negative consequences. For example, if they don't pay the payment, they are not legally bound to do so. There may also be ramifications with your insurance provider if the person taking over the loan is involved in an accident.\n\n### Trading In Your Still-Financed Car\n\nAs you can see, selling a car to an individual when you are still paying for the vehicle can be a complicated process, and that's putting it mildly. It is much, much easier to trade in a car that's still under a financing agreement to a dealer as opposed to selling it to a private party. When you trade your vehicle in, the dealership pays off the loan on your behalf, so you don't have to worry about that awkward period between selling the car and getting the title. The dealer also handles the paperwork, including the transfer of the car's title, so you don't have that hassle to deal with either.\n\nTo trade in your still-financed car, you will need to bring a few things along with you on the day of your trade-in. Come prepared with your loan info, including your account number and the payoff amount. You'll also need the vehicle's registration, your driver's license, proof of insurance, and the keys and remote key fobs for the car, if any. \n\nBe prepared for negotiations with whatever salesman you work with when doing a trade-in. Knowing what your car is worth is essential, since sales associates work on commission, and the more they can get out of the vehicles they sell, the more they make. Inversely, the less they give you for your trade-in, the more they make. There will likely be some back and forth on both accounts: the cost of your new car and the trade-in value that the dealership assigns to your old car. To get the best price for your trade-in, it is good practice to negotiate for the trade-in value and the cost of the vehicle you plan to buy separately. \n\n### Positive Equity and Your Trade-In\n\nWhen determining how much your trade-in is worth, the dealer will look at how much your car is valued at as opposed to how much you still owe on it. If you owe $5,000, and your vehicle is valued at $9,000, then you have $4,000 in positive equity. That amount can be applied directly to the cost of your new car, reducing its overall purchase price and serving in some instances as your down payment. \n\nPositive equity is subtracted from the price that you negotiate for your new vehicle purchase. You can add more money as a down payment (and may be required to, depending on your circumstances and your lender's demands) to drive off with your new wheels.\n\nThe trade-in value of your car will be shown on your contract, and it is a good idea to check that you are given the full credit you agreed to during negotiations when before you sign. \n\n### Upside Down Car Loan?\n\nOn the flip side of positive equity, you'll find its ugly cousin, negative equity. If you have negative equity in your car like around one-third of all borrowers, then your loan is said to be an upside down or underwater car loan. Simply put, this means that you owe your lender more than your car is worth based on its current market value. Can you still sell it or trade it? Maybe.\n\nTo determine if your car loan is upside down, subtract the payoff amount on the car from the amount you still owe on it. If your vehicle has a \"Blue Book value\" of $15,000, and you owe $17,000 on the car, then there is an underwater amount of $2,000. That presents some particular problems that may be overcome by working with your lender or paying the amount of negative equity from your pocket. \n\nDepending on your credit, you may be able to roll the negative equity into a new car loan. Doing that will, of course, increase the total amount you finance, which increases your monthly payment amount. \n\nThere are also some dealers who offer trade-in promotions that will pay off your car no matter how much you owe on it. These dealers want to get you through the door and sell you a new car. For someone underwater on a car loan, this type of offer can be a lucrative one.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Trading a Car Versus Selling It\n\nWhen it comes to getting the most out of your used car, is it better to trade it in or should you try to sell it yourself? There are definite pros and cons to both. \n\nTrading it in, as you can see above, is the simplest way to get rid of the car, especially with a lender's lien still attached. The process is much faster, and the dealership handles the paperwork. Drive your old car in, and drive away with a new car. Easy, peasy. \n\nHowever, trading your car in usually equates to losing at least some money. The dealer will never give you the car's value or the Blue Book price. He only makes money when he sells the car for more than he has in it. You stand to lose hundreds (maybe even thousands) of dollars by trading in a vehicle instead of selling it yourself. \n\nIn nearly every instance, you will get more for your car through a private party sale. Buyers are more willing to pay closer to the actual value of the vehicle than dealers since they don't have to factor in any markup on the car. \n\nHowever, for that extra cash from a private sale, you give up a lot of time, including the time it takes to advertise the car via Craigslist or other services, field inquiries, and arrange test drives and inspections. Then, there's also the time and trouble it takes to find a buyer who is willing to go the extra mile with the payoff issue that you'll face before getting a clear title for the car. \n\nThe bottom line is that when you have an outstanding loan on a car, it can be more hassle than it's worth to complete a third-party sale. With all the steps and legalities to consider, it may be a better option to trade your car in or wait to sell it once you have paid it off. However, if you find a buyer who understands the process and is willing to go through a few extra steps to own the car, you will likely get closer to your car's value by holding out for a private party sale.",

Only the sedan is available this time, as the wagon and Gran Turismo ended their run in the U.S. after 2019. \n\nThe 330i is powered by a turbocharged four-cylinder again producing 255 horsepower, while the M340i gets a turbocharged six-cylinder engine with 382 horsepower. Also, a manual transmission is no longer available as all models get an 8-speed automatic. \n\nA plug-in hybrid is expected, though, as is a new M3. \n\nNew features include a built-in voice assistant for the infotainment system, a fully digital instrument panel and driver assistance technologies that can perform minor steering functions. \n\nBMW, trying to be a technological leader, has injected that into the G20 3 Series. And that makes it more fascinating to see where its roots started as a compact premium car that was fun to drive.\n\n[View 7th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-3+series#year_min=2019&year_max)\n\n### 2012 - 2019 BMW 3 Series (F30 6th Generation)\n\n[![bmw-3-series-6th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/dnF38dkRzDg5Zbq3vbJko/e4052214564af456471914b183923eaf/bmw-3-series-6th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-3+series#year_min=2012&year_max=2019)\n\nThe sixth-generation 3 Series came for 2012, initially as a sedan and later in wagon form. The coupes and convertibles were rebadged the 4 Series. BMW continued to add technology, making its iDrive infotainment system standard on all models, as well as all of the engines turbocharged. \n\nA turbocharged four-cylinder powered the base 328i (later 330i) model, while the 335i (later 340i) continued with a turbocharged six-cylinder. Diesel power returned, but this time as the four-cylinder 328d, and also available with all-wheel-drive and as a wagon. \n\nThe M3 sedan features a turbocharged six-cylinder engine with 425 horsepower and a 0-60 mph time of under 4 seconds. \n\nOther firsts for this generation of 3 Series included the new Gran Turismo four-door hatchback model and the introduction of hybrid models: the ActiveHybrid3, later replaced by the 330e plug-in hybrid.\n\n[View 6th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-3+series#year_min=2012&year_max=2019)\n\n### 2006 - 2012 BMW 3 Series (E90 5th Generation)\n\n[![bmw-3-series-5th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7Jnwhr354c6qPJEPhY3PR/c15cbb2ef2db5fafc5d290b028a3a273/bmw-3-series-5th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-3+series#year_min=2006&year_max=2012)\n\nThe 3 Series continued to get larger and more powerful when the fifth-generation models started to arrive for 2006. Wagons and coupes quickly joined sedans. \n\nThe convertible, which appeared in 2007, switched from a fabric roof to a folding hardtop roof as was popular in the mid-2000s. That made it significantly heavier, but all variants grew from the E46. \n\nAgain with the previous generation, only six-cylinder models were available. \n\nFor 2007, the 3 Series gained a turbocharged model for the first time in the U.S. as the 335i and 335xi. \n\nAll-wheel-drive continued to be available, this time also on coupes and convertibles. A six-cylinder diesel option arrived for 2009 on the 335d sedan, another first. \n\nThe M3 coupe, sedan, and convertible came for 2008, now with a V8 that produced 414 horsepower.\n\n[View 5th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-3+series#year_min=2006&year_max=2012)\n\n### 1999 - 2006 BMW 3 Series (E46 4th Generation)\n\n[![bmw-3-series-4th-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6ww67x1Dc6AhPLePWSAVqM/77317127feb7be53007a3e96d65f5d2f/bmw-3-series-4th-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-3+series#year_min=1999&year_max=2006)\n\nContinuing to increase performance and refinement, the E46 models began to appear for 1999. A sedan, coupe, and convertible all returned but were joined by a wagon for the first time in the U.S. \n\nFor the first time in this country, only six-cylinder engines were offered, as the 323i and the slightly more powerful 328i. \n\nAll-wheel drive returned to the options list for some models, joined by features such as satellite navigation, side, and head airbags, and six-speed transmissions. \n\nThe M3 returned in 2001 as a coupe or convertible with 333 horsepower and either a manual transmission or a new automated manual option.\n\n[View 4th Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-3+series#year_min=1999&year_max=2006)\n\n### 1992 - 1999 BMW 3 Series (E36 3rd Generation)\n\n[![bmw-3-series-3rd-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6LQXchgAtqF8T7XYYlg4Kd/2ac4c00969ab228e86c1bd6e19f7c0a2/bmw-3-series-3rd-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-3+series#year_min=1992&year_max=1999)\n\nThe first models of the third-generation 3 Series began appearing in 1992. The car initially launched as a four-door sedan:  the four-cylinder 318i and the six-cylinder 325i. These models were significantly more substantial and more powerful than their predecessors. For the first time, some models were built in the U.S., as well as Germany. \n\nCoupe and convertible variants followed for 1994, and the M3 returned in 1995, this time with a 240-horsepower, six-cylinder engine and available in either coupe, sedan, or convertible for the first time. \n\nThe 328i replaced the 325i in 1996. \n\nFor the first time, a hatchback was offered, called the 318ti. Introduced in 1995, it was considerably shorter than the coupe and sedan and offered only four-cylinder power, but at a substantially lower price new. It was discontinued after 1999.\n\n[View 3rd Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-3+series#year_min=1992&year_max=1999)\n\n### 1984 - 1993 BMW 3 Series (E30 2nd Generation)\n\n[![bmw-3-series-2nd-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1ZBXmqTxogwZd3FBWi6FjW/64b29f72a501f7d94715823cdec7b241/bmw-3-series-2nd-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-3+series#year_min=1984&year_max=1993)\n\nThe second-generation, known as the E30, arrived for 1984 as a two-door but was quickly followed by a four-door sedan for the first time. \n\nThe 318i was powered by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine with 103 horsepower but was available with a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic. \n\nThe 318i was joined in 1985 by the 325e, which received a 2.5-liter six-cylinder engine with 121 horsepower, later replaced by the popular 325i model along with a convertible model. \n\nAll-wheel-drive was also available on the 325iX model for the first time. \n\nIn 1988, the M3 was introduced as a high-performance variant, with a 192-horsepower four-cylinder engine and only available with a five-speed manual. This particular M3 has since become a performance car icon among enthusiasts and is considered highly collectible.\n\n[View 2nd Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-3+series#year_min=1984&year_max=1993)\n\n### 1977 - 1983 BMW 3 Series (E21 1st Generation)\n\n[![bmw-3-series-1st-generation](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6Yv9Vrpbp8fVgFEt9kRxSp/8037ee59f3832779cb25d3002d9f279f/bmw-3-series-1st-generation.jpg)](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-3+series#year_min=1977&year_max=1983)\n\nThe 320i was available in the U.S. from 1977, replacing the long-running 2002 series. \n\nAvailable only as a two-door, it was initially only powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 110 horsepower and fuel injection. \n\nIn 1980, the 320iS model arrived, with upgraded seats, suspension, and a five-speed manual transmission, among other performance enhancements. \n\nWhile the 2002 was seen as a smaller vehicle, the E21 shared a similar design as the company’s larger sedan and solidified BMW as a maker of premium vehicles. Its rear-wheel-drive platform and sharp driving characteristics made it popular among enthusiasts, too. \n\nBut with its small interior and relatively thin list of equipment, it’s a far cry from the current 3 Series.\n\n[View 1st Generation Listings](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-3+series#year_min=1977&year_max=1983)",

      "body": "The C3 Corvette, built between 1968 and 1982, was the third generation of Chevrolet’s venerable Corvette sports car. Occasionally seen as polarizing, the C3 garnered both praise and criticism for its radical design, purpose and driving dynamics.  \n\nExpectations were huge when the model launched. Zora Arkus-Duntov and Billy Mitchell, the second generation C2 Corvette designers, had just built the hugely successful, powerful, and respected Sting Ray Corvette. Even today, the Sting Ray is widely regarded as one of the best Corvette models ever made.  \n\n![1968 Chevrolet Corvette W68HV CH009](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5aXAz1MD4SvIvo73WX9E16/9d32c4513ae10219eb131a33c2a6b0ad/1968_Chevrolet_Corvette_W68HV_CH009.jpg) \n\nThe pressure to build an appropriate C2 successor did not only come from the expectations set by the previous generation, though. The mid- to late- 1960’s saw the rise of the muscle car. Competitors like Pontiac, Buick, and even Chevy themselves were developing powerful and inexpensive cars with stellar straight-line performance.  \n\nIf the Corvette was to keep up, it had to distinguish itself somehow other than with pure acceleration, a fact that Duntov and Mitchell knew all too well.  \n\n\n### The Beginnings of the C3 Corvette ###\n\nC3 development started at the C2’s mid-cycle refresh. Frank Winchell, Chevrolet’s engineering director, Duntov, and Mitchell all set out to produce their idea of what the C3 should be.  \n\nAll three agreed that the front engine layout should be scrapped, and they planned their designs accordingly.  \n\nWinchell based his concept on a rear-engine design with styling cues taken from the Porsche 911 and current Chevrolet Corvair.  \n\nDuntov and Mitchell based their mid-engine design on the Mako Shark concept. Styling elements included a pointed nose, steeply raked roofline, and a flat, duck-tail rear-end design, all of which made their concept look aggressive and futuristic.  \n\nDespite the desire to create a mid-engined Corvette, budgetary constraints, the lack of appropriate mid or rear-engine parts compatibility, and weight distribution issues prevented the C3 from truly being what its designers envisioned.  \n\nThe front-engine layout along with the chassis and independent rear suspension would both be carried over from the previous C2 Corvette. To accommodate this, the C3 concept would have to be re-worked from its initial mid-engine compatible design to a more conventional design.  \n\nBilly Mitchell hired new designer Larry Shinoda to take on the task. The resulting concept would be the Mako Shark II, a design that could have taken on the mid-engine layout if anything were to progress toward that end.  \n\nIn 1965, a non-functioning concept was built and shown to the public to garner excitement, followed by a fully functional version. After a short hiatus, a more reasonably designed second run concept was introduced which provided a more realistic image of the soon-to-be C3 Vette.  \n\nThe “shark generation” Chevy Corvette was about to launch, but not before production was delayed one year from its original 1967 target release due to numerous design issues.  \n\n### The Early Years: 1968-1969 ### \n\n![1968 Chevrolet Corvette B3729-0308](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/43X7Hqj3rSHbPVWuVHS5Ml/ee3877b7b6f2c7c4f432f11958259966/1968_Chevrolet_Corvette_B3729-0308.jpg)\n\nThe C3 debuted for the 1968 model year. It closely resembled the second-run Mako II concept car shown to the public in 1965. It became known as the “Coke bottle” design for its sharp front end, upward-angled front fenders, slim midsection, and large swept rear fenders.  \n\nProduction models were essentially a marriage between the previous generation Corvette and the Mako II concept model. It was not as sharp and aggressively styled as the Mako II, but the chassis, suspension, and even some engine options remained the same.  \n\nNaturally, it was produced with a fiberglass body.  \n\nThe two-speed Powerglide transmission from the previous generation was replaced by the three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmission. A three-speed or four-speed manual transmission was also offered.  \n\nThe C3 came as a coupe or convertible. Corvette convertibles could be had with a removable hardtop while Corvette T-top coupes had removable roof panels and rear window. A “sugar scoop” design replaced the originally proposed fastback design, creating a vertical rear window with buttresses sloping from the roof to the rear on either side.  \n\nThere were plenty of engine choices. 327-cubic-inch small block engine power options included the standard 300-horsepower and L79 350-horsepower variants. 427-cubic-inch big-block engine offerings included the L36 390-, L68 400-, L88 430-, and L71 435-horsepower options.  \n\nThe prized L88 big-block engines were fitted with two-barrel Holley carburetors and Muncie manual transmissions. For fitment and inadvertent styling points, C3s equipped with big-block engines received a sizeable elevated hood bulge to accommodate the larger engine size over the small-block versions.  \n\nNotable features included windshield wipers hidden under a vacuum-operated panel, concealed exterior door handles, vacuum-operated pop-up headlights, functional fender vents for engine cooling, a rear defroster, an AM/FM radio, air conditioning, disc brakes, leather seats, and a speed warning indicator.  \n\nMinimal upgrades to the 1969 C3s included an optional trunk rack, smaller steering wheel, a stiffer frame, wider wheels, optional side pipe exit exhaust, and the iconic Corvette Stingray name, designated by a chrome fender plate.  \n\nSmall-block engines were upgraded to 350 cubic inches for 1969, producing greater compression ratios.  \n\nAs with many new vehicle redesigns, the first year of the C3 Corvette was met with criticism from the media. Build quality, styling, and other things were critiqued harshly. But by the second year, GM had worked out many of these issues.  \n\nEnthusiasts had embraced the new C3, and sales numbers were proving it.  \n\n### Growing Up: 1970-1972 ###  \n\n![1972 Chevrolet Corvette](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2XMqWiAGtDW3CRVhgB1zN4/94151a665229ef9d7a0083676d7be747/1972_Chevrolet_Corvette.jpg) \n\nThe 1970 to 1972 C3s continued to see small developments which ultimately made the ‘Vette a better vehicle, though build quality was reportedly still a major concern. By 1972, it was clear that change was on the horizon.  \n\nMinor exterior changes in 1970 included a revised egg-crate style grille and side fender vents, deeper fenders, rectangular exhaust cutouts, and side marker lights.  \n\nInterior changes were also minor but attempted to create a more inviting atmosphere for the passengers. Increased headroom, wood-grain trim, and door to door carpeting.  \n\nA new engine option was introduced in 1970. The small-block LT-1 featured a Holley four-barrel carburetor and produced 370 horsepower. All the other small-block engine options from 1969 remained the same while both the big-block engines – the LS5, producing 390 horsepower, and LS7, producing 460 horsepower – increased from 427 cubic inches to 454 cubic inches.  \n\n1971 saw stricter emissions regulations and started the trend of weakening engine outputs. The LT-1 notably dropped from a reported 370 horsepower to 330 horsepower while the LS5 saw its horsepower rating fall to 365. Another new 454 cubic inch engine, the LS6, was offered for 1971 which produced 425 horsepower. It replaced the canceled LS7 engine from the previous year.  \n\nThe ZR1 and ZR2 racing packages were available to the public. The ZR1 featured the LT-1 small-block engine and the ZR2 was paired with the LS6. Both included an upgraded suspension, upgraded radiator, and a special close-ratio four-speed transmission.  \n\nEmissions further choked the engine options for 1972. The ZR2 package was no longer offered because the LS6 was discontinued. The base ZQ-3 engine only produced 200 horsepower while the LT-1 was downgraded to 255 horsepower, and the LS5 produced 270 horsepower.  \n\nThe three-speed manual transmission was also dropped in favor of a standard four-speed manual for the 1972 model year.  \n\n1972 went out with a bang and signaled changing times for the C3 Corvette in the coming years.  \n\n\n### Major Changes: 1973-1974 ###  \n\n![1973 Chevrolet Corvette C2236-0102](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4djrFH6b16ky8AlZNjHa5d/00a1eda7ff71e5e74d561324e814df45/1973_Chevrolet_Corvette_C2236-0102.jpg)\n\n\nThe 1973 C3 came with some significant changes. It would be the 20th anniversary of the Corvette and mid-cycle refresh was in order.  \n\nThough the front-end design had not changed, the iconic pointy chrome nose and grille were replaced by safer urethane bumpers. The egg-crate fender vents were replaced with a single vent cutout. The vacuum-operated windshield wiper panel was gone and the hood was extended to obscure the wipers. The removable rear window was now fixed in place.  \n\n1973 was the only year in which a chrome bumper was affixed to only the rear of the Corvette. \n\n1974 saw a full change to impact bumpers on the front and back of the car. Rear bumpers were angled downward as opposed to the upward-pointing trunk lid which had always housed the round iconic Corvette taillights. Fender flairs extended out to give the profile a more aggressive look.  \n\nAn upgraded radiator, automatic transmission, and power steering pump were all fitted for 1974 models.  \n\nRadial tires, steel door beams, lap and shoulder belts, and safety bumpers were equipped to meet increasing federal safety standards. Cabin noise deadening was added to provide better comfort while traveling, a move that further solidified its place as a developing grand tourer rather than a hard-core sports car with muscle.  \n\nEmissions regulations continued to erode this mentality in 1974.\n\nThe base small-block L46 V8 engine coughed out 190 horsepower. The L82 small-block managed slightly better with 250 horsepower while the lone big-block option, the LS4, pumped out 270 horsepower.  \n\nFor further performance enhancement, the Gymkhana Suspension Package increased handling.  \n\nEven though the big-block engine outputs of the late ’60s made the ’73 and ’74 offerings look tame at best, the emissions regulations and OPEC oil embargo affected everyone. The Corvette still offered an increasingly luxurious driving experience with a good amount of comparable performance. Despite itself and its struggles, sales numbers were stronger than ever.  \n\n### The Transitional Years: 1975-1977### \n\n![1977 Corvette C2636-0196](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5XsDpXONkWIr4PahSZOJgX/168b46cf2d048e825e84f008a5553204/1977_Corvette_C2636-0196.jpg) \n\n1975 marked the beginning of the true transitional years for the third-generation Corvette C3.  \n\nIt was the first Corvette to have a catalytic converter fitted to the car, the first year a true dual exhaust setup was not equipped, and the first year a big-block engine option was not offered.  1975 was the last year that the convertible models were produced for this generation.  \n\nMore importantly, Zora Arkus-Duntov officially retired from GM, and Dave McLellan took over the reins.  \n\nEven though the C3 would be a decade old after the 1977 model year and major regulatory changes had all but neutered the iconic sports car, 1975-1977 saw over 130,000 units sold, with 1977 seeing the 500,000th Corvette roll off the assembly line.  \n\nThe front and rear bumper designs were slightly altered from the previous 1974 ‘Vette to decrease accident damage, and two pads on either side of the bumpers were added for additional bumper support.  \n\nOnly two engine choices were available: the ZQ3 350 cubic inch small-block which produced 165 horsepower and the L82 small-block which produced 205 horsepower. 1976 and ’77 engine offerings remained the same with slightly better outputs. The base engine produced 180 horsepower and the L82 was bumped to 210 horsepower.  \n\nA new ignition system, a fuel tank emission control system, and a light-on warning system marked new changes for 1975. For 1976, the cowl induction hood was eliminated, steel floor panels were added, aluminum wheels were added, two rear bumper assemblies were available with different Corvette lettering, power steering, power brakes, and a new steering wheel was offered.  \n\nThe Stingray badge was removed from the Corvette in 1977 and replaced with the current racing flag emblem present on Corvettes today. The radio, climate controls, and dashboard gauges were all restyled to add functionality and simplicity with leather seating becoming standard.  \n\nDespite the increasing cost to buy a Corvette – up to $10,000 for fully-equipped models – sales numbers soared over the previous years. \n\n### Rising Again: 1978-1979 ### \n\n![1978 Chevrolet Corvette Silver Anniversary Edition CX2766-0408](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5imvNxq3nfYIm0ZUQ3fhcZ/50bc22fbe740c1364f6e7225eda0a893/1978_Chevrolet_Corvette_Silver_Anniversary_Edition_CX2766-0408.jpg) \n\nThe economy was recovering, the oil crisis was over, and the Corvette was returning record high sales numbers. David McLellan had not fully gotten involved with the continuing evolution of the C3 Corvette, but subtle changes continued marching the Corvette forward into 1978 and 1979.  \n\n1979 was the Chevrolet Corvette’s 25th anniversary. As such the Silver Anniversary Edition was offered to buyers but was little more than a special silver over gray paint scheme with a pinstripe, special anniversary badging, sport mirrors, and aluminum wheels.  \n\nAn Indy 500 Pace Car version of the Corvette was also created as part of the celebration and featured the opposite black over silver paint scheme from the Silver Anniversary Edition. Front and rear spoilers, special interior colors, and revised leather seating were part of the Corvette Pace Car.  \n\nRegular Corvettes were offered with both anniversary package options with replica paint schemes and features.  \n\nAll Corvettes in 1978 featured a new fastback design which replaced the “sugar-scoop” rear window and flying buttress design with wrap-around glass. A new instrument gauge cluster, glass T-top panels, wider tires, and a revised anti-theft system were also equipped.  \n\n1979 saw standardized air conditioning, AM/FM radio, tilt and telescoping steering wheel, and power windows. Chrome rear window trim was replaced with black trim, tungsten-halogen headlights were added, seat upgrades were added, and the options from anniversary edition ’78 cars were made optional.  \n\nThe base small-block L48 produced 185 horsepower, and the L82 produced 220, which could be exclusively paired with a close-ratio four-speed manual or an upgraded Hydra-Matic three-speed automatic transmission. 1979 models received small horsepower increases to 195 and 225 horsepower.  \n\nCritics praised the 1978 and 1979 Corvettes for their revised styling and good performance for the day, while the special editions were a big hit among consumers. The 1979 Corvette turned out to be the best-selling Corvette of all time despite its first-ever $10,000 price tag to close out the 1970s.  \n\n![1979 Chevrolet Corvette 122104](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2MdIl8X8ahGsZV74InHrHf/baab1c54e22f4aa2723d9b4d2ced4781/1979_Chevrolet_Corvette_122104.jpg)\n\n### The Final Chapter: 1980-1982 ###  \nThe late ’70’s Corvettes may have been a huge sales success for GM, but the C3 was going on 12 years of production without a major refresh. Because of this, the last piece of the C3 Corvette puzzle was put in place by the final 1982 C3 Collector Edition before the next-generation C4 Corvette would start the next chapter.  \n\nEconomic woes and another fuel shortage again took their toll on what the Corvette would become in the next few years. One bright spot in Corvette history shined through in 1981 when production moved from St. Louis, Missouri, to Bowling Green, Kentucky, proving instrumental in better build quality that had been lacking in C3 Corvettes for years.  \n\nThe early ’80’s Corvettes maintained the same general sharp, aggressive look as previous years but with a smoother, more rounded front fascia and grille. Weight loss was a priority, and the use of aluminum and other revised materials throughout the car helped.  \n\nThe ‘Vette received a federally-mandated 85-mile-per-hour speedometer, the Corvette flag emblem was removed from the fender, and a revised hood was fitted as well.  \n\n1980 engine options included the L48, which produced 190 horsepower, and the L82, which produced 230 horsepower. California’s strict emission laws only allowed its residents a 305 cubic inch V8 engine producing 180 horsepower, only available with an automatic transmission.  \n\nStarting the next year, a single engine, called the L81, replaced both the L48 and L82 engines. It produced 190 horsepower, 280 lb-ft of torque, and featured stainless steel exhaust manifolds with additional cooling from an electric fan.  \n\nComputer Control Command was introduced to help with emissions by controlling ignition timing and the air-fuel mixture within the engine. Additional paint options were also added, including several two-tone paint schemes.  \n\n1982 was the last year of the C3. It bridged the gap between the current car and the future C4 by sporting the C4’s future fuel-injected 350-cubic-inch L83 V8 engine. It produced 200 horsepower and 285 lb-ft of torque. Unfortunately, a manual transmission was not available for 1982 models with a four-speed automatic being the only option.  \n\nOther 1982 additions included an in-tank electric fuel pump, a redesigned exhaust system, and “Cross Fire Injection” badging.  \n\nThe Collector Edition Corvette was the perfect farewell to the C3, offering a frameless lifting rear window, Collector Edition emblems, special alloy wheels, a unique silver-beige paint scheme, special exterior-matching interior colors with leather upholstery, and a $20,000 price tag.  \n\n### Looking Back ### \nThe “shark” model C3 Corvette had a huge impact on the automotive industry throughout its fifteen-year tenure. Its futuristic and stylish design was and continues to be one of the most recognizable in American history.  \n\nThough it did not change that much from year-to-year, its transformation from 1968 to 1982 is quite evident. Emission standards, economic downturns, and fuel shortages dictated what the Corvette would be from one model year to the next. Despite this, it survived, and it went on to set sales records still unbeaten today.  \n\nIts longevity, adaptation to ever-stringent regulations and evolved styling have all made the C3 one of the more popular Corvettes. Some aficionados even believe its performance relative to the models of today make it less desirable than it should be on the collector market.  \n\nValues are starting to rise, though, and the C3 is well-known as a good platform with which to work, improve, and ultimately enjoy as a true iconic Corvette.\n\n### [See our Eight generations of Chevy Corvette gallery](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/eight-generations-of-chevy-corvette) ###\n\n### [Previous generation: Corvette C2](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/chevy-corvette-c2-generation) ###\n\n### [Next Up: Corvette C4](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/chevy-corvette-c4-generation) ###",

      "body": "\n__Updated 7/19/19:__\n*Chevrolet has finally revealed the production 2020 Corvette C8. Here’s what we now know about this all-new midengine sports car:*\n\n![2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-Stingray-002](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/20uzTvxfGWsbBb3fVKj91v/3e20d561e74a5347c060d56b54cfb90a/2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-Stingray-002.jpg) \n\n### __Powertrain:__\nThe C8 uses a new generation small-block V8 engine. It’s a 6.2-liter unit that makes 490 horsepower and 465 pound-feet of torque in base form (495 horsepower and 470 pound-feet of torque with the optional Z51 package that also has a performance exhaust system). \n\n![DSC05513 copy](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/27BBDeqLzLqyv6QhWrtO00/99fc6ecf6434c178c9693d6ea8ac5599/DSC05513_copy.jpg)\n\nThis engine is mounted directly behind the passenger compartment. It’s connected to an eight-speed dual-clutch automated transmission with paddle shifters. \n\n### __Interior:__\n\n![2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-Stingray-014](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1TfhDa7C0hWFL32IAo8U3c/eccfcbfea2794560ccf6434eef280934/2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-Stingray-014.jpg) \n\nThe C8 seats two people. The instrument panel is a configurable 12-inch digital display. A touchscreen is mounted to the right of this and it controls the infotainment system. A long column of buttons for functions like the climate control runs down from the top of the dashboard to the bottom of the center console. \n\nA 10-speaker Bose sound system will be standard. A 14-speaker Bose system will be available as an option. \n\n### __Functionality:__\nThe C8 has a pair of trunks with a total of 12.6 cubic-feet of cargo space. There’s a small cargo area at the front of the car and a larger, deeper one at the rear. Chevrolet says owners will be able store two sets of golf clubs in the rear compartment. \n\n![DSC05485 copy](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3RAsWBLRsZUikPYS0HJryI/cd0a1ffcac8d3b14512129a5f11afc34/DSC05485_copy.jpg) \n\nAs has been Corvette’s long-standing tradition, there’s a standard removable roof panel that stores in the rear trunk when not in use.\n\nThe C8 will also be available with a front-end lift system to clear things like speedbumps and steep driveways. The system will raise the nose of the car 40 millimeters and Chevy says owners will be able to link it to the car’s GPS to remember up to 1,000 locations where the lift will function automatically.\n\n### __Chassis:__\n\n![2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-Stingray-043](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1WAXnmA7mwmUTwhVm63o8F/aa5b67c287f6c7fc678fe29fd904f0b3/2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-Stingray-043.jpg) \n\nThe main structure of the chassis is made from six pieces of diecast aluminum. The curved rear bumper beam is made from carbon fiber, which Chevy says is an industry first. \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### __Z51 Performance Package:__\n\n![2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-Stingray-035](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5KnWPeZDsqN2sRcHPQ4Ph0/e907afbd59199cc9deb668d80d1bf0bf/2020-Chevrolet-Corvette-Stingray-035.jpg) \n\nThe C8 will initially be available with this new performance package. In addition to the added power boost, the Z51 upgrade will also come with larger brake calipers, an enhanced cooling system, different axle ratio, front brake cooling ducts and a performance exhaust.\n\n\n\n### __Pricing and availability:__\n\n![2020CorvetteSingrayReveal013](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/fBuTcMsYFc4bhe1KMpQhj/f615d0d40dd77f1fae6aaa4428139727/2020CorvetteSingrayReveal013.jpeg) \n\n\nChevrolet hasn’t announced pricing on the C8 yet but it has confirmed that the base model will start at under $60,000 (so figure around $59,999). Production will start at Chevy’s Bowling Green Assembly plant in late 2019; expect early models to be available in early 2020. \n\n---\n### *__Previous story:__*\n\nThe 2020 Chevrolet Corvette, also known as the C8 Corvette, is an upcoming model of the brand’s two-seater performance car. Though spy photos and rumor articles have been circulating about the car for months before any official news, Chevrolet announced that the car would be formally unveiled at an event on July 18th, 2019. \n\nIt was also driven through the middle of New York City in a teaser event several months ahead of its launch with the car’s unveiling date stamped on its side.\n\n### New Layout ###\n\n![ZERV Square](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/LuQPjK12LHgu8NWNWWlyl/d11b83c478d58a0a4e87285fe7f404da/ZERV_Square.jpg)\n\nThe C8 will feature a mid-engine design, which is a first for the Corvette, previously only offered in front-engine, rear-wheel-drive configuration. \n\nThe mid-engine configuration allows the car to generate more power while maintaining traction than a traditional front-engine layout does. With the engine between the axles, weight distribution is much more balanced in the car, which significantly improves handling and cornering abilities. \n\nThe mid-engine layout also opens up a possibility for Chevrolet to include an all-wheel-drive system in the car, adding an electric motor to the “front trunk” area. In what could be an upgrade over “base” C8 models, the electric motor would drive the front wheels for on-demand traction.\n\nThe C7 Corvette’s high-performance versions, the Z06 and ZR1, have been noted as being fantastic sports cars. Some critics have mentioned that there is too much power for the car to be truly useful on the track without significant driving experience. Even with driver aids like traction and stability control, the lack of weight over the rear axle can present challenges in keeping grip and maintaining speed in performance driving situations. With a mid-engine layout, the Corvette’s driving dynamics will change significantly, and traction should improve as weight is moved rearward in the car.\n\n### Long Time Coming ###\nThis change is something that Chevrolet has had in the works for decades, as there have been prototypes that are known to date back as far as 1970. \n\nIn the mid-80s, Chevrolet debuted the Corvette Indy concept, which had a mid-engine setup, a twin-turbo V8, and all-wheel drive. \n\nYears later, in 2002, the Cadillac Cien concept was shown at the Detroit Auto Show. That car was also mid-engine with a 7.5-liter V12 that produced 750 horsepower. The engineers at Chevrolet had determined that the Corvette was at its peak, in terms of the amount of power and grip that could be delivered with a traditional front-engine, rear-drive layout. The massive recession of 2008 and its subsequent shockwaves caused the company to put the project on hold and eventually cancel it altogether. \n\n![ZERV DISC Overhead-square](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/66CGMNUFbJSwRh3tgHk2Yw/47911a2c22e509fea9ed37deeed2985d/ZERV_DISC_Overhead-square.jpg)\n\n### Road Tests ###\nThe C8 has been spotted several times conducting road tests in different parts of the country. In one such test, the Corvette was being tailed by a Porsche 911 Turbo S, a sign that Chevrolet is benchmarking its new C8 against cars that have traditionally been considered faster on the track. The mid-engine layout for the new Corvette also places it in a league of cars that have been reserved for brands like McLaren, Ferrari, and Lamborghini, whose supercars have long featured engines in between their axles. The mid-engine Corvette will join a very small number of American supercars and would be the only one with the mass-production muscle of a brand like GM.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### New Look ###\nMoving the engine behind the cabin will also result in a significant styling change for the C8 Corvette. Since the Corvette C2, the car has featured a long nose with a cabin located much closer to the rear axle than the front. The mid-engine layout will move the passenger compartment forward to accommodate the drivetrain components, which shortens the length of the hood. The rear of the car is also bulkier as a result, with large air vents on either side of the doors to help cool the engine. Spy photos show that the C8 will retain some of the Corvette’s traditional styling, as the quad taillights and nose look similar to the current C7 car.\n\nSpy photos of the next-generation C8 have shown what appears to be two lines to separate the car’s roof from the rest of the body. This could mean that the new car will have a targa-style roof, with removable panels, similar to the non-convertible C7’s current setup. All Corvettes since the late 1960s have featured this roof style, except for two Z06 models and the ZR1. We don’t yet know if the C8 will be available as a full-on convertible when it launches.\n\nSince the cars that have been spotted have all been covered in a great deal of camouflage, we don’t know exactly how the Corvette C8’s lines and curves will play out. We do know that GM has filed patents for new parts and design elements, like an engine cover for a car with a mid-engine layout. The new cover is made of glass and features venting around the outside to aid in cooling for the engine that would be mounted behind the passenger compartment. Prototypes that have been spotted so far have either featured an open engine area or one that has been covered in mesh.\n\n### Pricing ###\nAccording to reports from Hagerty, pricing for the C8 should start somewhere between $60,000 and $70,000. These prices are close to the C7 Corvette’s numbers, where the Stingray 1LT model starts around $57,000 before taxes, options, and destination. Dubbed the Corvette Stingray, the car’s base price includes a 6.2-liter LT1 V8 that has 460 horsepower and 465 pound-feet of torque and a seven-speed manual transmission. Other C7 models include the $67,000 Grand Sport, the $81,000 Z06, and the $123,000 ZR1. In its top form, the C7 ZR1 has a top speed of 212 mph, a 0-60 mph time of 2.85 seconds, and a supercharged version of the LT1 engine that produces 755 horsepower and 715 pound-feet of torque.\n\nThe C8’s pricing, according to Hagerty, will include an updated version of the C7’s V8 engine. The new powerplant will likely be named the LT2 and should be rated somewhere around 500 horsepower. Further investigation by Hagerty has shown that Chevy may be working on a more powerful version of that engine for higher-spec trims of the C8, possibly to include a twin-turbo overhead-cam V8 or one with a flat-plane crankshaft.\n\nWhile the current C7 Corvette comes standard with a seven-speed manual with the option to upgrade to an 8-speed shiftable automatic transmission, Car and Driver and Road and Track have reported separately that the C8 may only be available with a dual-clutch transmission. If true, the move would make the new Corvette the first without a manual transmission option.\n\n![ZERV DISC front 3-4](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2AJuZVcAYdMO6pk7dUV7s4/d72b949bb2e85af464614d145f938821/ZERV_DISC_front_3-4_.jpg)\n\n### Race Bred ###\nRacing has been a big part of the Corvette’s bloodline, and that will continue with the new C8. The car has been spotted testing on race tracks, potentially in preparation for the 2020 racing season. Pratt and Miller, the company responsible for building all other Corvette race cars since the C5, will again build the C8 model for entry into the IMSA WeatherTech Series. Spy photographers at the race testing sessions also captured audio of the C8 race car and report that the engine used in track testing produces a significantly different sound than the ones heard from the C8’s road-test sightings. This has created speculation that racing-specific versions of the new car will use a V6 or a type of flat-plane V8.\n\n### What’s in a Name? ###\nAt least one version of the C8 is rumored to be named “Zora,” after Zora Arkus-Duntov, the GM engineer that drove much of the early Corvette’s creation. Chevrolet has trademarked the name in several countries, including the US, the UK, China, Japan, and Australia.\n\nZora, the person, is known as the “father of the Corvette,” even though he didn’t create the car, and was a notably successful racing driver. There is speculation that the “Zora” name will be used for higher-performance versions of the new Corvette, and that the base model will keep the Stingray name that the current C7 Corvette’s base versions use.\n\n### Grand Unveil ###\nThe unveiling itself is newsworthy. Mary Barra, GM’s CEO, announced the debut at an event to honor firefighters and first responders killed in the World Trade Center attacks on September 11th, 2001. The media will be on hand to cover the new car and select Corvette owners and members of the public have been offered tickets for the chance to see the C8. \n\nThe National Corvette Museum placed a C8 event package up for bid on eBay recently, which included tickets to the event, a two-night hotel stay, and an invite to a special “Expo” hosted by the museum that includes an opportunity for a close-up view of the car and time to chat with members of the C8 development team. Bidding started at $100 and eventually reached a winning bid of $15,200 – around 25% of the rumored cost of the new car.\n\n### Built in Kentucky ###\nWe know that the Bowling Green, KY plant where the Corvette has been built for nearly 40 years will employ a second shift and add over 400 employees to build the new C8. GM recently made the announcement but did not indicate if the move was made to cover anticipated demand for the new model or to increase quality control and slow production. \n\n### Sales cooling ###\nWe do know that as rumors and speculation for the new C8 have heated up over the past year, sales of the current-generation C7 have cooled off significantly. In the first quarter of 2019, sales numbers dropped over 11.5%, to under 4,000 units– some of the lowest in the current generation’s lifespan.\n\n### [See our Eight generations of Chevy Corvette gallery](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/eight-generations-of-chevy-corvette) ###\n\n### [Previous generation: Corvette C7](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/chevy-corvette-c7-generation) ###\n\n",

      "body": "The C2 generation of Chevrolet Corvette was built between 1962 and 1967 for the model years of 1963 through 1967. It was the second generation of Corvette and was popularly known as the Corvette Sting Ray. The C2 naturally evolved from the previous C1 generation. \n\nThe 1962 Corvette -- the final year of the C1 generation -- offered a more appealing physical appearance as well as sharper handling and more horsepower than the rest of the first-gen models. Many of these design elements from the rear of the car naturally evolved into the C2's look.\n\n### Development of the C2 ###\nLike the last year of the C1, the new Corvette C2 featured a long nose, a compact cabin and a short back end with peaked fenders. The general shape of the car was the same. However, there were some marked differences as well. \n\nThe most prominent change was the appearance of the front end. The new C2 now featured folding pop-up lights whereas the C1 had four round headlights. The grille and bumper were styled differently as well, and the coupe had a rear split window. \n\nThe development of the Sting Ray came out of two different GM projects. These were the Q-Corvette and the racing Sting Ray, which was a project of three GM designers: Pete Brock, Bill Mitchell and Larry Shinoda. \n\nThe design program leading to the first model of Sting Ray was called XP-720, and its goal was to give the new Corvette a better ride, better handling and more room for both passengers and luggage. \n\nThe exterior of the Sting Ray stuck with fiberglass outer body panels but added significantly more steel support vs. the previous generation of Corvette. \n\nThe Sting Ray ended up with almost twice as much steel, but designers didn't want it to have increased weight, so they decreased the fiberglass thickness. This resulted in a Corvette that weighed even less than the previous one. \n\nThe wheelbase ended up being a bit tighter, but the interior room remained the same. A steel girder reinforced the cockpit for both strength and safety.\n\n![1963 Corvette C2709-0033](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1TF8vKWSezCyqNuApxiyIK/e7b890000a54f1e396a81da67a2f79b3/1963_Corvette_C2709-0033.jpg)\n\n### C2 Interior and Exterior Styling ###\nAnother new feature for the C2 generation was the availability of a Corvette coupe; the previous generation was a convertible only. The futuristically styled fastback had an interesting design element for the time in a divided rear window. Instead of one window pane, it was two separate panes with a narrow space of body between them. This was a feature only available on the 1963 model; subsequent model years switched to a conventional one-piece rear window. This limited availability of the split-window models has made the 1963 models highly sought after by collectors. \n\nThe C2's quad headlights from the previous generation were actually still present but hidden as folding lights. This was a Corvette design marker that would continue up until the C6 generation. The coupe doors were cut partially into the roof to make it easier to enter and exit the low profile car. \n\nInitially, the designers wanted functional vents on the car's hood but were forced to turn them into faux ones due to rising costs. Inside, the car was a bit more practical than before. The glovebox had increased room and the dash sported a new set of round gauges, including a larger speedometer and tachometer. Even though the interior was roomier, the lack of an external trunk meant that luggage had to be loaded behind the front seats.\n\n### Improved Chassis ###\n\n![1963 Chevrolet Corvette 055 Corvette 06-0193](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/hld4ncDIXKAnSStf7aoWd/677f59cd9c67a1aabc32a80e1e2c8a02/1963_Chevrolet_Corvette_055_Corvette_06-0193.jpg)\n\nAlthough the striking appearance of the new C2 was more obvious than its improved chassis, the latter was at least as important as the styling to the eventual success of the Sting Ray. \n\nQuicker Ball-Race steering and a short wheelbase made the C2 handle and maneuver better than the C1. A short wheelbase can contribute to a more jarring ride in some circumstances, but for the C2, it had improved weight distribution to reduce that. For example, the front wheels carried less weight to make steering easier while the rear wheels carried about 80 more pounds to improve traction. \n\nThe standard cast-iron, 11-inch drum brakes remained on all four wheels, but increased width made them more effective in braking situations. \n\nOptional brake packages included power assist, finned aluminum drums and sintered-metallic linings. The latter two features were designed to keep the brakes cooler.\n\n\n### C2 Engines and Transmissions ###\nThe C2 offered five engines during its run. The 327 cubic-inch small-block V8 was available in the following year ranges and horsepower:\n\n- 1963 through 1965: 250 horsepower\n- 1963: 340 horsepower optional\n- 1963 through 1967: 300 horsepower\n- 1965 through 1967: 350 horsepower optional\n- 1964 through 1965: 365 horsepower optional\n\nThe 327 fuel-injected small-block V8 was offered in 1963 with 360 horsepower and in 1964-1965 with 375 horsepower. \n\nThe 396 cubic-inch big-block V8 was offered in 1965 with 425 horsepower.\n\nThe 427 big-block V8 was offered in 1966-1967 with 390 horsepower and then only in 1966 with 425 horsepower. \n\nFinally, the 427 big-block Tri-Power V8 was offered in 1967 in a 400 horsepower version and a 435 horsepower version.\n\nThe C2 Corvette only offered three transmissions during its run, including a three and four-speed manual transmission and a two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission.\n\n### C2 Model Changes From 1963 to 1967 ###\nThe __1963__ Sting Ray came standard with a 250 horsepower, 327-cu-ft engine with optional versions that made as much as 360 horsepower. Acceleration was improved over the previous generation due to the lighter weight. \n\nIn __1964__, the Corvette had only various small changes, including the elimination of the faux air intakes on the hood. On the other hand, the faux vent on the rear pillar was made functional on the left side of the coupe. The suspension was slightly improved for this year as was the sound insulation. Drivetrain choices remained the same, except that the 365 horsepower engine had a new four-barrel Holley carburetor instead of the previous Carter. Sales of the 1964 model improved slightly over the first year of the C2.\n\n![1965 Chevrolet Corvette Convertible 51593](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6XJ2D2o1BQQnfMQyzIA68S/ae036792b8a258826fada31924616e08/1965_Chevrolet_Corvette_Convertible_51593.jpg) \n\nIn the third model year of the C2, the __1965__ Sting Ray added a totally new braking system and larger engine choices. The 396 big-block V8 made its debut with a huge 425 horsepower at the time. Another small-block V8 producing 350 horsepower was added with the modification of hydraulic lifters vs. solid. Another big addition for this year was four-wheel disc brakes. The hood styling was cleaned up with no indentations and the front fenders now had vertical exhaust vents that were fully functional.\n\nThe fourth model year was __1966__ and the big-block V8 was now available in two forms: one with 390 horsepower and the other with 425. At this point, big-block engines were far more in demand vs. small-blocks, so Chevy cut the available small-blocks to two choices vs. the previous five. These two were the 300 and 350 horsepower versions. The front of the 1966 Sting Ray was slightly modified with an egg crate grille. A new emblem also now adorned the hood corner and on the inside, headrests were a new option.\n\nThe last year of the C2 was __1967__ and with five years of tweaks under the hood, it was considered the best of the bunch. The overall changes were modest, however. The three large fender vents were replaced with five smaller ones and only one backup light was used right above the license plate. The optional hardtop for the Corvette convertible was outfitted with a new black vinyl cover, which was a popular fad at the time. The main engine change was the available 427 with Rochester 3x2-barrel carburetors called the Tri-Force. This engine was factory-rated at 430 bhp, but in truth, it was more like 560 bhp. The engine also required special racing fuel rated at 103-octane, which was not readily available. This engine was not marketed at the casual Corvette buyer, but rather at those who were seeking a competitive race car.\n\n![1966 Chevrolet Corvette](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4LYBQ5QJKtEkEpEi6y2cr6/1ea2e1fadc4555b8871555000c63ab4d/1966_Chevrolet_Corvette.jpg)\n\n### Z06 Package ###\nThe Z06 was essentially a racing package and it was offered for the first time on the 1963 model Corvette. The options included in this package were:\n\n- Vacuum brake booster\n- Dual master cylinder\n- A 20 percent larger front antiroll bar\n- Stiffer shocks and springs\n- Finned aluminum drums with cooling air scoops and vents\n- Brakes with sintered metallic linings\n- 36.5-gallon gas tank- 5.4 liter, 360 horsepower, 327 cubic inch engine with fuel injection.\n\nThis package was initially only offered on C2 coupes due to the larger gas tank, which wouldn't fit on convertibles. Eventually, the package was offered on both coupes and convertibles, and the gas tank was taken off the standard package but remained optional for coupes.\n\n### Grand Sport Racer ###\nThe Grand Sport Corvette was a secret project triggered by competition with the Ford Shelby Cobra. Zora Arkus-Duntov, the Corvette chief engineer, initially had plans to build about 125 models of the Grand Sport. However, the project was halted when GM executives found out. Only five Grand Sport cars were built in the end and they're all currently in private collections. The Grand Sport design included thinner fiberglass panels, and one of the engines used was an all-aluminum small-block engine that made 550 horsepower and 6400 rpm.\n\n### [See our Eight generations of Chevy Corvette gallery](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/eight-generations-of-chevy-corvette) ###\n\n### [Previous generation: Corvette C1](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/chevy-corvette-c1-generation) ###\n\n### [Next Up: Corvette C3](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/chevy-corvette-c3-generation) ###",

      "body": "The Chevrolet Corvette is an icon of American automotive history and one of the most recognized and revered cars across the globe. The first-generation Chevrolet Corvette (commonly referred to as the C1) debuted in 1953 at the General Motors Motorama event at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York City. \n\n![1953 Corvette Motorama Show Car B3729-0279](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6vOihAgw4JPX86Hn4HoI8q/ef596a4f429b40b3a5d73e272fd44a5e/1953_Corvette_Motorama_Show_Car_B3729-0279.jpg) \n\n### Early Corvette Inspiration ###\nThe C1 Corvette had a nine-year production run when it was replaced by the second-generation Corvette, or the C2, in 1962. Penned by legendary car designer Harley Earl, the Chevy Corvette drew inspiration from numerous sources. Earl wanted to create a true American sports car, and he noticed all the European sports cars that American GIs were bringing home with them after their service in World War II. Another inspiration was the Nash-Healey, a two-seat sports car from Nash Motors. Earl and his team created \"Project Opel\" in the early 1950s, which eventually became the original Corvette we know today. \n\nAnother notable member of the Corvette team was Zora Arkus-Duntov, the head Corvette engineer and commonly referred to as the 'Father of the Corvette.' Duntov joined the team after seeing the original car at the Motorama event, and he became the man responsible for many of the car's innovations, much of its early racing success and the implementation of the successful Grand Sport program. Of Duntov's many accomplishments with the Corvette, developing it into a proven sports car was one of his most significant. Duntov and his team set a stock car record at the Pike's Peak hillclimb in 1956, and also set a new record at Daytona Beach by hitting 150 mph in the flying mile.\n\nDuntov's Grand Sport program launched in the final year of the C1 Corvette in 1962. The program was focused on creating a lightweight racing Corvette that could compete against established marquees. Only five original Grand Sports were built with a 550-horsepower aluminum small-block V8 engine. These incredibly rare cars weren't formally allowed to go racing by GM and ended up in the hands of private car collectors.\n\n![1953 Chevrolet Corvette D-1953-CORVETTE-1953 Chevrolet Motorama Corvette 2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4IdNCPvHWYKyw3p2Uv2Uug/482fe091040083d3ef5732f7163099e1/1953_Chevrolet_Corvette_D-1953-CORVETTE-1953_Chevrolet_Motorama_Corvette_2.jpg)\n\n### 1953: First Attempt ###\nThe very first production Chevrolet Corvette C1 rolled off a makeshift assembly line in Flint, Michigan in June of 1953. The initial batch of cars, which was limited to only 300 units, were all black canvas soft tops, and all wore the now iconic Polo White exterior color scheme and featured an equally iconic red interior. Under the hood, they used a 3.8-liter inline six-cylinder engine (no V8 yet) with three Carter carburetors, mechanical lifters, and a high-lift camshaft. Nicknamed 'Blue Flame,' the engine produced 150 horsepower and was mated to a two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission.\n\nEarl's design for the C1 Corvette is beautiful and immediately recognizable. The Corvette convertible's styling is tight and compact and features sweeping lines that run from the headlights over the rear fenders, white-walled wheels, taillights that protrude in classic 1950's styling, and a unique chrome grille. Instead of a steel body, GM used fiberglass to shape the Corvette; it was one of the first instances of such extensive use of then-revolutionary lightweight material.\n\n### 1954: Production Expands ###\n\n![1954 Chevrolet Corvette](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1HNBgOreTb9QwY2ckUxaXw/078d7940b4cec8c9884d12ea7d3480e8/1954_Chevrolet_Corvette.jpg)\n\n1954 saw a significant increase in the Corvette's production run, with some 3,640 cars being produced. General Motors also expanded the colors customers could get their Corvette in - Sportsman Red, Black, and Pennant Blue - and increased the engine's output to 155 horsepower.\n\nIn 1955, the Corvette received arguably its most significant update ever, an improvement that would set the template for all future Corvettes. This was the year that GM put a 4.3-liter small-block Chevy V8 engine under the Corvette's hood, dramatically increasing power over the six-cylinder to 195 horsepower. GM fitted the Corvette with a three-speed manual transmission, the first time the car featured anything other than an automatic transmission. These improvements were well received and helped improve the Corvette's sportscar credentials. Chevy built 700 Corvettes for the 1955 model year.\n\nMore improvements and upgrades arrived in 1956 including a removable hardtop, exposed headlamps, a redesigned exterior that now included the famous 'coves' or sculpted side scoops, and manual roll-up windows. Horsepower was again bumped up - the small-block V8 now made up to 240 horsepower - and the original inline six-cylinder engine from the first year Corvettes made was phased out entirely. Duntov, who was instrumental in continually pressing GM to improve the Corvette's performance, tried to convince GM to formally begin a racing program with the car but to no avail. He'd have to wait a little longer for that to happen.\n\n![1957 Corvette 50367](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6Ldds4Ylz0jUXtwJEOb1mN/88051c8e28170444a17291f1c6d841a5/1957_Corvette_50367.jpg)\n\n### 1957: New Technologies ###\n'57 Corvettes benefited from yet more advanced technology including optional fuel injection and a limited slip differential. If a Corvette had fuel-injection back then, they were given the nickname 'fuelie.' The car's V8 engine was increased to 4.5-liters and made around 290 horsepower, increasing the car's top speed to a reported 132 miles-per-hour. A new four-speed manual transmission was also introduced in 1957. \n\nAnother notable achievement made by this year's Corvette was that it became one of the very first mass-produced engines to achieve a rating of one horsepower per cubic-inch, something Chevrolet capitalized on with their \"One HP per cubic inch\" marketing slogan. '57 Vettes could also be had with heavy-duty racing suspension and other premium racing-derived components. Chevy also offered a tachometer that could be mounted to the steering column on 'fuelie' optioned models. This was also the last year that GM used 'Polo White' on the Vette.\n\n### 1958: Headlight Split###\n![1958 Corvette Convertible 251618](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7GIap2VHhH5SwPLgajaVRS/e46211e73ded2cc78bb093ffd1313021/1958_Corvette_Convertible_251618.jpg) \n\nUpdates for the 1958 Corvette were substantial and focused primarily on the car's exterior. The single headlights with mesh covers were replaced with a four-headlight design (two on each side), the hood was given faux louvers, and the trunk area received unique chrome accents. The interior also got an update, most notably the new instrument cluster which placed the tachometer directly in front of the driver. 1958 also marked the year that the Corvette finally turned a profit.\n\nDespite the philosophy of continuous performance improvement, the power output for both the 1958 and the 1959 Corvettes remained constant and didn't change. 1959 also only saw minor interior and exterior changes as well. A turquoise soft top color was available (the only year this was offered, actually), there was a new 'T-shift' handle for the four-speed gearbox, and sun visors could be had as an optional extra.\n\n### 1960: Iconic Taillights ###\n\n![1960 Chev Corvette Convertible C2709-0031](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2RivtuZQ7DrrgoLDrQ3XGk/fbec260daca853db0c346e6450b383be/1960_Chev_Corvette_Convertible_C2709-0031.jpg) \n\nFor 1960, Chevrolet gave the Corvette aluminum radiators and the rarest factory paint color to come on any Corvette: Cascade Green. There are reportedly only 140 cars wearing this color. The 1960 model year Corvette also marks the final time the car would have its taillights molded into the rear fenders. The following year would see new rear lights that echoed the car's headlights - four lights, two on each side of the vehicle, placed into the bumper. These new taillights would become one of the Corvette's signature design elements. 1960 marked the first time that the Corvette crested the 10,000 unit-per year mark with Chevrolet producing 10,261 cars with a base price of $3,872.\n\n### Pop Culture ###\nIn popular culture, the Corvette was featured in the hit television show 'Route 66'. The show ran for four seasons on CBS and followed the adventures of two men, Tod Stiles and Buz Murdock, crossing the United States in their Chevrolet Corvette. A 1960 model Corvette was the first car to be used in the show, and the characters would use a new model year Vette with each new season. When the show ended in 1964, the characters were driving a 'Saddle Tan' colored C2 Corvette. \n\n\n\nSeveral classic Corvette styling elements were changed with the 1961 model year. In addition to new taillights, this year marked the end of white-walled tires and the word 'Corvette' was spelled out on the car's nose instead of the round emblem found on previous cars. The two-tone paint job in the car's cove area was eliminated, and also gone were the chrome \"teeth\" on the front grille in favor of a mesh screen over the radiator opening. The rear of the car was changed to a new 'boat-tail' design, and power from the engine was increased to 315 horsepower for the most powerful fuel-injected V8 engine. \n\nThe 1962 Corvette was the last model year to use a solid rear axle. Solid axles had been a feature of the Corvette since the original car back in 1953. A new engine was another major update for the Corvette: Displacement on the V8 was increased to 5.4-liters, and power swelled to a maximum of 360 horsepower. \n\nAnother element of the Corvette that changed was the exposed headlights. That styling element disappeared for decades while pop-up headlights became the norm until 2005 when the C5 model Corvette brought them back. \n\n1962 also saw the largest production run of the Corvette in the car's history to that date, with over 14,500 cars. The car's price also reached a new high point with a base sticker of $4,038. \n\n\n\n### C1 Production Ends ###\n\n\n1962 was the final year of the C1 Corvette. Over its nine-year run, the C1 Corvette became a legitimate competitor to the sports cars coming from Europe. The next iteration of the Corvette, the C2 in 1963, would see significant changes to the Corvette's body style, a new design language, improved performance, and the introduction of perhaps the most famous moniker in the Corvette's history: 'Sting Ray'.\n\n### [See our Eight generations of Chevy Corvette gallery](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/eight-generations-of-chevy-corvette) ###\n\n### [Next Up: Corvette C2](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/chevy-corvette-c2-generation) ###",

      "body": "The C7 generation of Chevrolet Corvette was produced between 2013 and 2019 for the model years 2014 through 2019. As the name implies, it's the seventh-generation Corvette and the first since the C3 to use the Chevrolet Corvette Stingray name. \n\nThe C7 Corvette took a few of its general design cues from the previous C6 Corvette, including keeping the exposed headlights. \n\nHowever, much of its styling was a dramatic departure from all previous models. Its look was highlighted by a more muscular and angled front end and taillights that deviated from the traditional arrangement of two sets of round lenses. \n\nThe first C7s hit the market in the third quarter of 2013; the last of the C7s were sold in the first half of 2019. It is widely expected to be the last front-engine Corvette in light of its successor -- the C8 -- moving to a mid-engine layout.\n\n### Development of the C7 Corvette ###\n\n![2018-Chevrolet-Corvette-041](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1Cq83xqXDfi9kf8taGSOGM/d9a059a0f7dad5073ad9dd211fe56320/2018-Chevrolet-Corvette-041.jpg) \n\nChevy began the C7 development in 2007, but the financial crisis and General Motors' bankruptcy delayed the model considerably; it wasn't until late in 2012 that Chevrolet announced that the C7 would debut in January of 2013.  It was originally set to debut as a 2011 model.\n\nThe C7 almost became the first Corvette with a mid-engine layout, but potentially high development costs (when G.M. had little expendable capital) kept the C7 in the traditional front-engine / rear-wheel-drive setup. \n\nThe C7 instead featured a new 6.2-liter small-block V8 engine that made 455 horsepower and 460 lb.-ft. of torque in base form. A seven-speed manual transmission was offered as well as a six-speed G.M. automatic. The small-block V8 included a cylinder deactivation system for fuel management and continuously variable valve timing. \n\nThe new powerplant helped the C7 to accelerate from zero to 60 in 3.8 seconds.\n\nThe suspension on the C7 was an independent double-wishbone setup with unequal length, plus transverse fiberglass mono-leaf springs.\n\n### C7 Styling and Reaction ###\nAs previously mentioned, the C7 took its styling in a different direction from all previous generations, despite keeping a few elements such as the exposed headlights. \n\nPerhaps the biggest difference was the squared-off rear end and non-round, trapezoidal taillights that were similar to those on the Camaro at the time. The aggressive and angular appearance was a source of disappointment for many Corvette fans, though G.M. said it was a deliberate move aimed at attracting a younger audience than traditionally bought Corvettes.\n\nThe C7's rear end was also highlighted by four tailpipes mounted at the center of the lower bumper. Along with the aggressive back end, the C7 featured a large number of creases and vents around the body for aerodynamics. This was a large design departure from previous generations that had streamlined styling with few creases save semi-functional gills. Even the new exposed headlights had a more intricate and angular design than the C6 Corvette.\n\n![2018-Chevrolet-CorvetteConv-044](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6MR2OWjYi8lC1J8w5sEAl0/43a9764746c063d40d8889a7384ffffc/2018-Chevrolet-CorvetteConv-044.jpg)\n\n### 2014 Model Year Equipment, Changes and Editions ###\nThe new C7 Corvette featured a carbon fiber hood and then fiberglass composite for the majority of the rest of the car. Aerogel developed by NASA was used to stop transmission heat from getting into the cabin. Panels on the underbody were made from carbon-nano composite while the chassis was constructed from hydro-formed aluminum. Indirect LED technology was used in the formation of the taillights. \n\nDespite the full use of light materials in constructing the C7, it wasn't any lighter than the previous C6 generation. \n\nThe 2014 Corvette offered the following models and special editions:\n- Corvette C7 Stingray Coupe\n- 3LT Interior Package\n- Z51 Performance Package\n- C7 Corvette Stingray Convertible\n- Corvette Stingray Coupe and Convertible Premiere Edition\n- Gran Turismo, Atlantic and Pacific concepts\n\n![2018-Chevrolet-Corvette-Carbon65-Edition-003](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1AHtergNFUCDLipowNtPKV/1796af096e758bbcf9f3c0af0b9b04ab/2018-Chevrolet-Corvette-Carbon65-Edition-003.jpg)\n\n### 2015 Model Year Equipment, Changes and Editions ###\nThe 2015 C7 model year saw the introduction of an optional eight-speed automatic transmission for all models. \n\nThe new Corvette Z06 was reintroduced for this year as well. It featured a new 6.2-liter supercharged V8 engine that made 650 horsepower and 650 pound-feet of torque. For this generation, Chevy made the Z06 available in both a coupe and a convertible. \n\nDual-mode exhausts became standard for Z51 Corvettes. \n\nA performance data recorder was a notable equipment addition and included a 720p H.D. camera, self-contained telemetry recorder and dedicated SD-card slot in the glove box.  The PDR system had several modes, including track mode, sport mode, touring mode and performance mode. These were essentially modes aimed at competition drivers to help improve lap times. \n\nThe 2015 Corvette offered the following models and special editions:\n- Z06 and Z07 Performance Package\n- Z06 Convertible\n- Corvette Stingray Atlantic Design Package\n- Corvette Stingray Pacific Design Package\n- Corvette C7.R\n\nThe last model in this list was a racing version of the Chevrolet Corvette Z06. It included a 5.5 liter naturally aspirated V8 engine, which was made specifically for this model. It had 491 horsepower and a modified suspension to allow for wider tires and a larger brake system.\n\n\n![2018-Chevrolet-CorvetteConv-045](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5kCL8whPMtUpXwy4UR2BIJ/03c7948b5843fe4748ece7f735cde540/2018-Chevrolet-CorvetteConv-045.jpg) \n\n### 2016 Model Year Equipment, Changes and Editions ###\nThis model year saw the phasing out and removal of four colors and the addition of one color. Daytona Sunrise Orange Metallic was removed in December 2015. January 2016 saw the removal of Night Race Blue, and then Shark Gray was removed some months later in May. \n\nThe end of 2016 saw the removal of Laguna Blue, which was replaced by a new color called Admiral Blue. Only 336 total C7 Corvettes were made in this color, including 221 Stingray models and 115 Z06 models. Otherwise, nothing else for this year was changed. \n\nThe following models and special editions were released for the 2016 model year:\n- Twilight Blue Design Package ZLD\n- Spice Red Design Package ZLE\n- Jet Black Sueded Design Package ZLG\n- Z06 C7.R Edition ZCR\n\nThe special design packages were all available on 3Lx trim models and included different options for Z06 and Stingray models. Despite the color names of the packages, each package had several choices in actual exterior colors for the car. The last special edition was only available with the 3LZ trim and was mostly an appearance package despite the name. However, it ended up being fairly rare as only 650 cars were produced between the coupe and convertible editions. The convertible was the rarest at only 80 produced.\n\n![2018-Chevrolet-Corvette-042](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1uFoSHdzjDSjdIcFohMXDU/e4c8fac2dc756b5c86ba78a5e7089e41/2018-Chevrolet-Corvette-042.jpg)\n\n### 2017 Model Year Equipment, Changes and Editions ###\nNothing significant was changed for the 2017 model year; a total of 32,782 C7s were produced. This year did see the introduction of the brand new Grand Sport model, which was a mix of the Z51, Z06 and the Stingray components and body styling (the body style was mostly modeled on the Corvette Z06). \n\nThe Grand Sport featured the following design elements:\n- New Grand Sport wheel design with 19x10 front wheels and 20x12 inch rear wheels\n- Pilot Super Sport summer tires by Michelin\n- Brembo brake system\n- Magnetic ride control and an electronic limited-slip differential as standard features\n- LT1 V8 engine producing 460 horsepower with dry-sump oiling system and performance active exhaust system\n- Seven-speed manual transmission with rev match\n- Optional Z07 package with different tires and brakes\n\nThe Grand Sport also had a Heritage Package, code-named Z15, that included various additional design features and six available colors. Finally, there was also a Grand Sport Collector Edition, code-named Z25. These were limited to only 1,000 vehicles and 850 of those were released in the American market. This edition was mostly cosmetic with special interior designs.\n\n### 2018 Model Year Equipment, Changes and Editions ###\n\n![2019-Chevrolet-Corvette-ZR1-Convertible-016](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3cuP8T0oLXriw66tlcmdxw/65754835a2a9f6ab65064eaa7e470154/2019-Chevrolet-Corvette-ZR1-Convertible-016.jpg)\n\nThe 2018 model year began production in 2017 in June. It was discontinued at the end of July due to a plant shutdown that lasted until October. This model year saw the continuation of the Stingray, Grand Sport and Z06 models.\n\nThis was also the year Chevy announced the ZR1. Like the Z06, it too used a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 engine, but it made 755 horsepower and 715 pound-feet of torque. The ZL1 came with a seven-speed manual transmission or an eight-speed automatic. It was further differentiated from lesser Corvettes with unique carbon fiber bodywork that was aimed at providing more cooling to the car's systems, plus a large rear spoiler. Other upgrades included Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, a unique exhaust system and unique wheels. Initially, the ZR1 was only revealed as a coupe, but a convertible version was eventually revealed as well.\n\n![2019-Chevrolet-Corvette-ZR1-013](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/22JNfXp6jc8uZ9Q0Qwiiyk/1cbf030fbdc31e7b5b4e5e0556b99f53/2019-Chevrolet-Corvette-ZR1-013.jpg) \n\nChevy sold 9,686 Corvette models for 2018 -- the lowest number since 1959 -- largely due to the short production time. \n\nNothing significant was changed during this year, but there was yet another special edition in the Carbon 65 or Z30 Edition. This limited edition was made to commemorate the 65th anniversary of the Corvette. It was available in a new color of Ceramic Matrix Gray and could be had via the convertible and coupe body styles of either the Grand Sport 3LT trim or the Z06 3LZ trim. Most everything in this special edition was cosmetic.\n\n### 2019: Final Model Year ###\nG.M. announced that 2019 would be the last model year for the C7 Corvette. The last-ever C7 production model -- a black Z06 coupe -- was auctioned off on June 28th, 2019. \n\nA special edition was released in this model year called the Driver's Edition of the Corvette Grand Sport. It included four different paint schemes chosen by the drivers on the Corvette racing team. \n\n### [See our Eight generations of Chevy Corvette gallery](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/eight-generations-of-chevy-corvette) ###\n\n### [Previous generation: Corvette C6](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/chevy-corvette-c6-generation) ###\n\n### [Next Up: Corvette C8](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/chevy-corvette-c8-generation) ###",

      "body": "\nThe Corvette C4 is the fourth generation of the iconic sports car from Chevrolet, produced from 1984 to 1996. The car was designed by Dave McLellan, who had replaced Zora Arkus-Duntov as Chevrolet's chief designer in 1975. \n\nThe C4 marked an important new stage in the evolution of the Corvette; it had a different chassis than the C3, and its body panels and bumpers were made of molding plastics instead of fiberglass. It also had a more streamlined style and it reintroduced the convertible after an 11-year hiatus. \n\nThe Corvette C4 was a major step toward the look and feel of modern models.\n\n### Departing From the Stingray Design ###\nThe Corvette C3 that the C4 replaced was based on the Mako Shark II concept car, itself inspired by the sleek body and long snout of the shortfin mako shark. It featured a highly stylized design with a sporty, swooping front and \"sugar scoop\" roof treatment. \n\nBy contrast, the C4 had tighter, more understated proportions and downplayed its sports car lineage. In departing from the classic \"Stingray\" design of Vettes from the 1960s, the C4 embraced a more futuristic sensibility. \n\nUnlike the body-on-frame construction of earlier Corvettes, the C4 was built with a uniframe. Not to be confused with a unibody assembly, in which the exterior body panels are structural members, the uniframe combines critical elements of the car, such as the windshield frame, into one welded unit. \n\nThe C4 also replaced the coil springs in the C3's front suspension with a much lighter transverse fiberglass mono-leaf spring. Finally, instead of the T-tops of its predecessors, the C4 features targa tops.\n\n### The Release of the C4 Corvette ###\n\n![1990 Corvette ZR1 C5909-R774-0007](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6DMthrpd0DCMXodMieDcwZ/ffef52d0f1a5a68d3b3ca6ff0778be73/1990_Corvette_ZR1_C5909-R774-0007.jpg)\n\nFrom 1963 until 1984, the year in which the C4 came out, the Corvette's design had remained largely unchanged. The C3 had even inherited the same chassis and suspension design as its predecessor. \n\nDespite a year-long delay due to quality issues, the C4's overhaul of the Corvette was a financial success, with sales figures for this line of cars doubling after the C4's release. A total of 51,547 C4 Vettes were sold in 1984 for around $21,800 each. \n\nBuyers appreciated the car's modern amenities, such as the instrument cluster with a digital LCD and the 16-inch 50-series Goodyear Gatorback tires. \n\nThe 1984 model also featured the small-block L83 V8 engine from the 1982 Corvette, which includes the short-lived throttle-body Cross-Fire fuel injection. It put out 205 horsepower and 290 foot-pounds of torque. \n\nDue to a lack of support for the fuel injection, some modern car collectors are critical of the 1984 Corvette. However, 1984 C4s are some of the most affordable collectibles on the market, with some well-maintained units selling for as low as $6,000, as of 2019.\n\n### The Evolution of the C4: 1985 to 1986 ###\nThe second half of the 1980s saw a steady refinement of the C4, especially when it came to the vehicle's power. In 1985, the controversial L83 V8 engine was replaced with a more powerful and fuel-efficient L98 featuring the tuned-point fuel injection found in Camaros and Firebirds. This engine was capable of 230 horsepower and 330 foot-pounds of torque, and the car's top speed is 150 mph. \n\nAt the time, this speed was matched only by Buick Grand Nationals and modified Ford Mustangs. The suspension for the 1985 C4 was also softened by 25 percent. Chevrolet sold 39,729 units for an average of $24,891 each.\n\n1986 saw one of the Corvette C4's biggest shifts. For the first time in 11 years, Chevrolet sold a Corvette convertible in addition to the standard Corvette coupe model. Based on the yellow C4 convertible pace car used in the 1986 Indy 500, the Corvette convertible sold for an extra $6,000 and featured an Indy 500 pace car plaque. \n\nThis was also the year in which Chevrolet introduced the Pass Key I passive anti-theft system. This system only unlocked the car doors if it detected one of 15 electrical resistance values produced by a special pellet in the car keys. However, car thieves quickly learned how to bypass the system. \n\nThe 1986 Corvette also introduced antilock brakes, electronic climate control and a third brake light. In 1986, a total of 35,109 C4s were sold: 7,315 convertibles and 27,794 coupes. The price for a C4 coupe was $27,027.\n\n### The Evolution of the C4: 1987 to 1989 ###\n\n![1984 Corvette 70646](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1I3RWJHvHSAGqmFO9FxHw1/ff961491e74ae8f300ff5ac66e915522/1984_Corvette_70646.jpg)\n\nIn 1987, the Corvette C4's engine gained roller hydraulic lifters to boost its horsepower to 240. Customers who wanted to supercharge their engine could buy the $19,999 B2K twin-turbo engine conversion, supplied by Callaway Cars in partnership with Chevrolet, to increase the engine's horsepower to 345 and its torque to 465 foot-pounds. The result was one of the fastest cars of its time. \n\nA specially modified C4 known as the Callaway SledgeHammer reached a top speed of 254 mph. C4 Vettes with twin-turbo engines are collector cars, as only about 500 exist. \n\nIn 1987, 30,632 C4s were sold.\n\nThe 1988 model year saw the release of the 35th Anniversary Edition Corvette, also known as the Triple White Corvette. This car is all-white, including its wheels and interior, and features a special engine and removable black top. Of the 2,050 Anniversary Edition Corvettes produced, only 180 have manual transmissions. \n\nC4s also underwent suspension changes and a new wheel design in 1988. The emergency brake was also moved toward the rear of the car for easier entering and exiting. In 1988, 22,789 C4s were sold. 1988 was the last year the Doug Nash 4+3 transmission was available. This transmission combined a four-speed manual with an automatic overdrive on three gears. The ZF six-speed manual replaced the 4+3 in 1989. Although the ZF featured no improvements in power or efficiency, it was more expensive. In 1989, 26,412 C4s were sold at a base price of $32,045.\n\n### The Evolution of the C4: 1990 to 1993 ###\n\n![1990 Chevrolet Corvette C5909-0599](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/SLMHiXgVgTARhMjmMeziT/49bd0186ac31f0260a84789a85ff4d55/1990_Chevrolet_Corvette_C5909-0599.jpg)\n\nWith the help of Group Lotus, a UK-based engineering consultant, Chevrolet sought to produce the fastest production car in the world.\n\nThe result was the ZR1, a Chevrolet Corvette C4 option package released in 1990, which broke the record for the 24-hour, 5,000-mile land speed, achieving speeds of 175 mph. \n\nThe C4 ZR1 cost $58,995, making it by far the most expensive Corvette up to that point. However, the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 sold well. Over 3,000 people bought it in the first year, and some paid over $100,000 for it. \n\nThe regular C4 also saw refinements in 1990: a drivers-side airbag and an optional 200-watt six-speaker sound system. In all, 23,646 C4s were sold in 1990.\n\n1991 saw minor tweaks. The cost for a C4 rose to $33,005, and the exterior had some restyling. 20,639 C4s were sold. \n\n1992 saw much larger changes. Most notably, the LT1 V8 replaced the L98, delivering 300 horsepower and 330 foot-pounds of torque, plus the short-lived optically triggered Optispark ignition system. 1992 also witnessed the one-millionth Corvette ever made. The price for a standard C4 rose to $33,635, and 20,479 of the cars were sold. \n\nIn 1993, Lotus helped Chevrolet modify the C4's valvetrain, exhaust system and aluminum cylinder heads to improve power and torque. Passive keyless entry was added to all models as well, and an exhaust re-circulation system was introduced to make controlling emissions easier. This model year also saw the release of the 40th Anniversary C4, featuring ruby metallic paint and ruby leather seats. At a base price of $34,595, a total of 21,590 C4s were sold in 1993.\n\n### The Evolution of the C4: 1994 to 1996 ###\n\n\n1994 didn't see many changes. The base price rose to $36,185, a passenger airbag was added, and the LT1 engine received a mass airflow sequential fuel injection. In all, 23,330 Chevrolet Corvette C4s were sold. \n\n1995 was similarly uneventful. It saw a second-generation Optispark ignition system and some exterior restyling. The car cost $36,785, and 20,742 were sold. \n\n1996, however, was an important year for the Chevrolet Corvette C4, as it was the vehicle's last year of production. An optional LT4 engine was produced, delivering 330 horsepower. Plus, an optional real-time damping system was available, which monitored the road to reduce vibrations.\n\nThe 1996 C4 also debuted Chevrolet's OBD II onboard diagnostics system. In addition, Chevrolet released the Chevrolet Corvette Grand Sport to celebrate the end of this generation of Corvettes. Inspired by the Grand Sport of 1963, this Grand Sport came exclusively in Admiral Blue with a white stripe and featured black wheels and bold red hash marks on the driver's side wheel arch. Only 1,000 Grand Sports were made: 190 convertibles and 810 coupes. \n\n1996 also saw the release of a Collector's Edition Corvette, featuring silver wheels and a Sebring Silver paint job. 5,412 of these cars were built: 1,381 convertibles and 4,031 coupes. In all, 21,536 C4s were sold in 1996 at a base price of $37,225.\n\nWith its streamlined design and a slew of new features, the Chevrolet Corvette C4 was a bold leap into modernity. The C5, released in 1997, continued the trend, opting for a hydroformed box frame and a rear-mounted transaxle assembly. Today, the C4 is perhaps best known for its spate of offshoots and variations, many of which have become collectibles.\n\n\nThe Corvette C4 is the fourth generation of the iconic sports car from Chevrolet, produced from 1984 to 1996. The car was designed by Dave McLellan, who had replaced Zora Arkus-Duntov as Chevrolet's chief designer in 1975. \n\nThe C4 marked an important new stage in the evolution of the Corvette; it had a different chassis than the C3, and its body panels and bumpers were made of molding plastics instead of fiberglass. It also had a more streamlined style and it reintroduced the convertible after an 11-year hiatus. \n\nThe Corvette C4 was a major step toward the look and feel of modern models.\n\n\n### [See our Eight generations of Chevy Corvette gallery](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/eight-generations-of-chevy-corvette) ###\n\n### [Previous generation: Corvette C3](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/chevy-corvette-c3-generation) ###\n\n### [Next Up: Corvette C5](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/chevy-corvette-c5-generation) ###",

      "body": "The Corvette C6 is the sixth generation of Chevrolet’s two-seater sports car. It was sold between 2005 and 2013 and was replaced by the C7 Corvette. \n\nThe C6 had updated styling, new technology, upgraded suspension, and a larger engine over the previous C5 Corvette. Compared to its predecessor, the passenger compartment of the C6 was bigger, the overall car was shorter by about five inches and the wheelbase was longer, to improve handling and ride quality. The C6 was also the first generation Corvette to feature exposed headlights since 1962. \n\n\n### Fresh Start ###\nDevelopment of the car began in 2000, with the goal being to “tighten” the body design to make it smaller and more space-efficient while keeping a clear visual tie to previous models. At the time, the Corvette engineering team stated the goal was not to invent a totally new car, but to perfect the details that were already in place.\n\nThe C6 Corvette was introduced as both a coupe and convertible, for the first time since 1968. All versions of the hardtop coupe C6 came with a removable panel in the roof for a targa-style experience.\n\nThe LS2 engine under the C6’s hood was all-new and produced 400 horsepower and 400 pound-feet of torque. It was paired with either a six-speed manual or an automatic transmission. In 2008, the engine was updated again, this time to an LS3. Displacement increased to 6.2 liters and power jumped to 430 horsepower and 424 pound-feet of torque. Combined with the lighter weight of the car, performance was improved greatly over its predecessor, with 0-60 mph times of just over four seconds.\n\n![2005 Chevrolet Corvette Conv CX05CH CR059](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3Q8qC6ImSDukwYCNmcJZWg/9d55e82609a9e64bde14311d08f754de/2005_Chevrolet_Corvette_Conv__CX05CH_CR059.jpg) \n\nThe Corvette C6 was rated at just 15 mpg city with an automatic transmission and 16 mpg with a manual transmission. In order to avoid a gas guzzler tax, Chevrolet updated the manual versions of the car with a computer-aided gear shifting system, which allowed the driver to shift directly from first to fourth gears at low speed. This bumped the fuel economy ratings enough to avoid the tax threshold.\n\nAt the time, even the standard Corvette C6 was well-liked by critics and the public. Reviewers liked the car’s improved handling, stronger engine, and improved interior.  Ride quality was noted as being impressively smooth and balanced. Critics praised the car for having improved on the previous Corvette C5 in nearly every way, from performance to refinement to comfort. The Corvette C6 was regarded as a bargain, with one reviewer noting that anything within $20,000 of the Chevrolet would have a very hard time beating its performance. The Porsche 911 at the time was several thousand dollars more than the Corvette and could not match its performance. \n\nToday, the Corvette C6 is still regarded as a pre-owned sports car value. Prices for well-kept examples hover between the $30,000 and $40,000 marks, and the performance is comparable to many new cars costing thousands more. Early models are noted as being plagued with quality and mechanical issues, but later versions do not have those problems. Used car shoppers will find an easy time locating several great examples of the C6 on eBay and elsewhere. Even performance-modified versions like the Callaway Corvette are relatively easy to find.\n\n![2005 Chevrolet Corvette X05CH-CR039](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3CEtBjBlF0Yw3BKtqTGSwg/d4a9d4b1ed85da623862f9f8272f2fdf/2005_Chevrolet_Corvette_X05CH-CR039.jpg)\n\n### Corvette C6 Z06 ###\nLater in its first year of production, the C6 became available in a high-performance Corvette Z06 model. It was equipped with the largest small-block engine ever made: A 7.0-liter called the LS7 V8. The engine produced 505 horsepower and 470 pound-feet of torque. A dry-sump oil system and titanium alloy connecting rods were fitted to the engine. \n\nThe Z06 coupe’s frame was constructed out of aluminum, which saved 136 pounds over the standard C6’s steel frame. Suspension components got an upgrade too, as the springs, shocks, and anti-sway bars were stiffer. The C6 Corvette Z06 models were visually differentiated from their standard counterparts with a unique front fascia, different front fenders and wider, unique wheels - though the resulting car was not necessarily a widebody.\n\nThe Z06 was so popular at launch that dealers had a hard time meeting customer demand. In some cases, cars were documented as having been sold for thousands above MSRP. \n\n### Corvette C6 ZR1 ###\n\n![2008 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 254518](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2CfP7iN73nasGqji9ccCMn/77a2676abc203dca794d8254eaf1e2d4/2008_Chevrolet_Corvette_ZR1_254518.jpg) \n\nThe Corvette C6 ZR1 took the Z06’s performance up yet another level. The Corvette ZR1 had been rumored for years before actually being confirmed by anyone at Chevrolet or GM, eventually leaking out under the codename “Project Blue Devil”. \n\nAs we see with the Corvette C8 today, spy photographers caught the C6 ZR1 being tested in camouflage and began leaking photos of parts well in advance of the car’s actual announcement. In 2007, General Motors started releasing details of the project publicly. In December of that year, the car was officially announced with photographs and details. \n\nThe Corvette C6 ZR1 came with a supercharged 6.2-liter LS9 V8 that had 638 horsepower and 604 pound-feet of torque. Autobahn testing of the car showed a top speed of 192 mph, but Chevrolet claimed the ZR1 could actually reach a top speed of up to 205 mph.\n\nThe C6 ZR1 was built with a great deal of carbon fiber. The roof, hood, fenders, rocker moldings, and front splitter were all made out of the very strong and lightweight material. The hood came with a polycarbonate window, which allowed the intercooler to be seen from outside the car. Carbon-ceramic brakes with blue calipers were added, as was magnetic ride control. The system used sensors to automatically adjust stiffness levels based on road conditions and vehicle performance.\n\n![2009 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 255348](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/42Agjuik4y1Oj76KLxuj4b/2f69723183e0a6d84cd5609f4f987daf/2009_Chevrolet_Corvette_ZR1_255348.jpg)\n\n### Corvette C6 Grand Sport ###\nIn 2010, a Grand Sport model was announced at the 12th annual Corvette Birthday Bash at the National Corvette Museum. It was fitted with several enhancements over the standard Corvette C6, including a new manual transmission with different gear ratios, larger anti-sway bars, stiffer springs, updated shocks, a larger spoiler, a transmission cooler, brake cooling intake ducts, and unique wheel designs.\n\n![2011 Corvette 269418](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/fHILof41byxeaIOlgMS0T/a834614e5d055217b1e932f891aa6586/2011_Corvette_269418.jpg) \n\n### Motorsport Success ###\nThe Corvette C6 was (and still is) a successful car in motorsports events around the world. The C6.R was a car built by Pratt & Miller as a race-only model based on the Corvette C6. Race organizers will often require that cars entered for competition meet homologation requirements. These rules state that, in order to be raced, a car must also be produced for street use and meet certain production numbers. The C6.R had a unique benefit over its predecessor, in that it was developed alongside its street-going counterpart, the Corvette C6. This meant that it could be designed more aggressively with fewer restrictions, as many of the race-inspired engineering could be added to the standard C6 along the way. \n\nThe road and race cars both benefitted from this arrangement. The race cars were able to be fitted with aluminum frames from the road cars, which reduced weight. Both cars’ fixed headlight units reduced drag and further cut weight. The Z06 benefitted as a high-performance model, as it was able to be upgraded with parts and designs directly from the racing engineers.\n\nThe C6.R was lauded as an innovative engineering project at the time. The car’s engine, while not from a road-going Corvette C6, was closely related to the LS7 from the Z06. It won awards for its performance and endurance abilities. The engines also featured a cylinder deactivation feature that would activate during caution periods to save fuel, much like road cars on the highway today. Like many race cars, the C6.R did not have a rear window – a result of the car’s bodywork and fuel tank placement. To help improve visibility, a camera was placed in the rear bumper and a monitor was mounted inside the cockpit, which gave the driver a rear view without relying solely on the side view mirrors. The C6.R also had an air conditioning system, which helped drivers deal with the extreme temperatures that are generated inside a race car. \n\nThe C6.R was unveiled at the 12 Hours of Sebring race in 2005 and landed at second and third in its class at that race. It was displayed later that year at the New York International Auto Show, along with the Corvette C6 Z06.\n\nIn 2006, the car won both American Le Mans GT1 Championships, and the next year it won the GT1 class in the 12 Hours of Sebring race. Through 2009, the cars won several other championships before being retired. A GT2 version was developed and run after that, and the C6.R was also available for sale to private racing teams.\n\n![2013 Chevrolet Corvette](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/Li0BTKx2x2uXwDQBTxt52/c2685b55d73982bee9e42063b02d975b/2013_Chevrolet_Corvette.jpg)\n\n### Special and Limited Editions ###\nSeveral limited-run versions of the Corvette C6 were made to commemorate special events or drive sales. \n\n__Corvette ZHZ__ \nIn 2009, the C6 was released as a ZHZ limited edition for the Hertz Corporation. The cars had an LS3 engine, a six-speed automatic transmission, and yellow paint with a wide black stripe. Only 500 cars were produced: 150 targa tops and 350 convertibles.\n\n__GT1 Championship Edition__\nThe C6 GT1 Championship Edition was made to celebrate the Corvette C6.R’s entry into the GT1 class. It was fitted with special wheels and graphics.\n\n__Z06 Carbon Limited Edition__ For the 2011 model year, a Carbon Limited Edition was released. It had black headlights and mirrors, a ZR1-style spoiler, and carbon fiber hood, rockers, and splitter. The interior was upgraded with leather and suede seats and color-matched stitching.\n\n### Summary: ### \nThe Chevrolet Corvette C6  is the sixth generation of the brand's iconic two-seater sports car. It was sold between 2005 and 2013 and replaced the outgoing C5 model. The cars featured a brand new engine, updated electronics, more refined suspension geometries, and lighter construction over their predecessor. Performance from the Corvette C6 rivals many new cars today, with acceleration reaching the low four-second range. The cars were released in several versions, many of which were higher-performance than the original. The Z06 and ZR1 are the two most popular and widely-available versions of these cars, each with a stronger engine and upgraded performance over the standard Corvettes. At the time, the C6 was praised for its refinement and sheer speed, which matched or beat cars that cost several tens of thousands of dollars more than the Chevrolet. The Corvette C6 is still regarded as a good car today, with many critics regarding it as a used car bargain.\n\n### [See our Eight generations of Chevy Corvette gallery](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/eight-generations-of-chevy-corvette) ###\n\n### [Previous generation: Corvette C5](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/chevy-corvette-c5-generation) ###\n\n### [Next Up: Corvette C7](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/chevy-corvette-c7-generation) ###",

      "body": "### Ground-up redesign ###\nThe Corvette C5 is the fifth generation of the Chevrolet Corvette that was produced between 1997 and 2004. The cars were a significant update over their predecessor, the Corvette C4, and featured an all-new engine, a new frame, updated transmission location, and completely different styling. The C5 was sold as both a Corvette coupe and a Corvette convertible, but first-year cars were only offered in coupe format.\n\nAs an overhaul of the previous generation Corvette C4, the new C5 had very few parts in common with older versions of the car. It also did not share parts with any other GM product, as Chevrolet’s engineers took the opportunity to push the boundaries of performance and technology. The resulting car was regarded as being drastically better than before.\n\nThe cars featured several innovations that were considered high-tech at the time. The C5 was used to test out several technologies that were used in other vehicles later on. Standard ABS and traction control were both features that weren’t particularly common at the time. A heads-up display was offered that projected vehicle information onto the windshield, and an Active Handling System was introduced as an option in 1998 before becoming standard in 2001. \n\nThe C5 was the first Corvette to feature drive-by-wire throttle, where the vehicle's acceleration is driven by an electronic sensor and gears, rather than through a mechanical pedal and linkage. Variable effort steering was also used, which changes the level of power steering assist based on the speed of the vehicle.\n\n![2001 Chevrolet Corvette](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4GFvKnNwNawZ7P5r5RZ0Sh/c2b174280ab624ef763e0acddffd0834/2001_Chevrolet_Corvette.jpg)\n\n### Powertrains ###\nThe Corvette C5 debuted with an all-new GM 5.7-liter V8 engine, dubbed the LS1. IT was rated at 345 horsepower and 350 pound-feet of torque. The C5 was the first vehicle to use the engine, but it went on to be used in the Camaro and Trans Am. The LS1 was also used as the foundation for other higher-performance variations at the time. The LS6 was based on the LS1 and was used in the Corvette C5 Z06, the Cadillac CTS V-Series. The powerful engine was enough to make the Chevy Corvette competitive with most vehicles at the time, even supercars, helping the car reach a 0-60 mph time of around 4.5 seconds.\n\nThe C5’s transmission was changed as well. All previous Corvettes had the transmission mounted at the rear of the engine but was relocated for the Corvette C5 to become a transaxle. It was located between the rear wheels, which gave the new car better weight distribution and improved handling.\n\nThe Corvette C5’s chassis was completely redesigned from previous versions of the car. The previous multi-piece welded frame was replaced with a one-piece hydroformed chassis with a composite balsa-core floor and cast aluminum windshield frame that added a great deal of rigidity. It was so stiff that no extra supports had to be added to make the convertible handle well.\n\nThe C5 was produced and sold for most of its lifespan with few changes to the fundamentals of the car. The engine became more powerful, more options packages were offered, and there were cosmetic updates, but the car did not change significantly. \n\nDespite the engine’s large displacement and power, the Corvette C5 achieved decent fuel economy numbers – 18 mpg city and 25 mpg highway with the automatic transmission. Those ratings helped the C5 avoid the gas guzzler tax that many other vehicles in the class are faced with. The Corvette C5’s low curb weight of under 3,300 pounds and the low drag coefficient are thanked for boosting the car’s fuel economy and for making it the most fuel-efficient Corvette yet.\n\n![1997 Chevrolet Corvette CX7660-7VET-0020](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/B3Vs1EO4EGST9nBuvcE2C/8e7edff7011d6ac2b67313360a319aa9/1997_Chevrolet_Corvette_CX7660-7VET-0020.jpg)\n\n### Corvette Z06 ###\nFor the 2001 model year, Chevy introduced a high-performance version of the C5, called the Z06 Corvette. It was the successor to the ZR-1 and was named after the Z06 version of the Corvette C2 from the 1960s. The new Z06 had a tuned version of the LS1 engine that produced 285 horsepower, which was less than the ZR-1, but thanks to the new car’s lower weight, it outperformed the old car in nearly every way – save for top speed.\n\nThe C5 Corvette Z06 was offered with only a six-speed manual transmission and had several modifications to make it faster than the base Corvette. It was based on the most rigid version of the Corvette C5, the hardtop coupe, which greatly improved handling. Further bumping the sporty ride quality, Chevrolet’s engineers fitted the car with upgraded FE4 suspension, larger wheels and tires, different gear ratios, and brake cooling ducts. Weight was cut from the standard C5 as well, with the Z06 making use of a titanium exhaust, thinner glass, lighter wheels, reduced sound insulation, and a lighter battery. \n\nAfter just one year of production, power was bumped in the Z06, up to 405 horsepower and 400 pound-feet of torque, as the LS6 was modified with a larger air intake, stiffer valve springs, and more aggressive camshaft timing.\n\nIn 2004, a special edition Z06 was released, called the Z16. It used a carbon fiber hood, aluminum wheels, special paint, and special edition badges. The car also had specially-tuned shocks that improved handling. Despite being a special edition, the Z16 made up most of the Z06s sold in 2004.\n\nAt the time, the Corvette C5 was improved, noted by reviewers as being a remarkable improvement over the C4 that came before it, without being a radical departure from the Corvette formula in general. Car and Driver, in its review, said that the Corvette C5 had gained some “latitude,” which meant that the car was finally capable of generating broad appeal outside of just Corvette lovers. The C5 was reviewed as being much more user-friendly, more comfortable, and more able to be used as a daily driver. \n\nThe Corvette C5 was praised as being the first version of the American sports car that blended all-out speed with usability, and it won over many critics at the time. The C5 was regarded as being balanced and precise, with an effort to take driver comfort into account, rather than just being fast at the expense of all else. The original price tag of over $38,000 meant that it was still an exclusive affair, out of reach for many, but for those that could afford it, the Corvette made a lot more sense than it ever had before. \n\n![1997 Chevrolet Corvette 74704](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2CKcASvVolGPyOAX9QLo4W/54660311c059539d5c5ddf7ba8eae132/1997_Chevrolet_Corvette_74704.jpg)\n\n### High production numbers ###\nThe C5 was produced in relatively high numbers throughout its lifespan – nearly 250,000 - which means that there aren’t many versions of the car that are considered rare or “special.” Only one engine was used for the standard Corvette C5 (LS1) and only one for the Z06 (LS6), which makes it different than Corvettes before it that had rare cars with special engine options.\n\nBecause of its production volume, there is still a good supply of used examples available today The convertibles and Z06 models are considered to be the most desirable, but early coupes can be had for less than the price of a new Corolla today. The first coupe models sell for $15,000 and less with convertibles just slightly more expensive than that. \n\nZ06 cars from the later years are a bit more, hitting the mid-$20,000 range. Some regard the Corvette C5 as one of the best used performance bargains on the market today. For less than $25,000, buyers can find a car that runs a sub-12-second quarter mile. That, coupled with the vast aftermarket support, make the cars very popular with racers and used car buyers.\n\n### Special and Limited Editions ###\n\n__Indianapolis 500 Pace Car__\nThe 1998 Corvette C5 Convertible was chosen as the Indianapolis 500 Pace Car, and a replica was offered for sale as a result. Other than the safety equipment that was fitted to the official Pace Car, there was no functional difference between the replica and the original. The Pace Car Replica Package came with special paint colors, yellow-painted wheels, and decals.  The cars also came with luxury entertainment features like a Bose sound system, upgraded dual-zone climate controls, and leather upholstery. The Pace Car Package is widely regarded as being one of the more controversial and over-the-top appearance packages ever offered on a Corvette.\n\n__50th Anniversary Edition__\n2003 marked 50 years of Corvette production, and Chevrolet created a special edition C5 to commemorate the occasion. The cars were available as either a convertible or coupe and were offered in only one color – Anniversary Red Metallic. Anniversary Corvette C5s also came with magnetic ride control, painted aluminum wheels, and special badging.\n\n__Motorsports__\nThe Corvette C5 was used extensively for racing applications during its lifespan. The C5-R was a race car based on the standard Corvette that was built by Pratt & Miller for GM Racing. It had a longer wheelbase, wider track, and a larger 7.0-liter V8 engine. \n\nThe C5-R had a long and remarkable run in motorsport, winning several races throughout its use. During its first season in 2001, the car won eight out of its first ten races, including a win at the 24 Hours of Daytona and the top two places in the GTS class at Le Mans. The C5-R went on to win at the 24 Hours of Sebring, the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and other races over the years.\n\n### [See our Eight Generations of Chevy Corvette gallery](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/eight-generations-of-chevy-corvette) ###\n\n### [Previous generation: Corvette C4](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/chevy-corvette-c4-generation) ###\n\n### [Next generation: Corvette C6](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette/chevy-corvette-c6-generation) ###",

      "body": "### Pros:\n\n- Striking design\n- Strong performance and responsive powertrain\n- Compelling standard and optional technologies\n\n### Cons:\n\n- Premium price point\n- Sloping roof reduces rear headroom\n- Advanced safety tech is held back for higher trims\n\n### Summary\n\nThe 2019 Audi A7 is a four-door hatchback that is marketed and sold in the premium and luxury vehicle segments. The car was redesigned for the 2019 model year with a new but similar exterior design, overhauled interior technology, and updated powertrain features. The A7 is very closely related to the A6 sedan, sharing much of its underpinnings and engineering.\n\nThe car is aimed at new car buyers that are shopping for a German luxury sedan with more usable space and a unique look. The hatchback design and folding rear seats give the A7 the ability to perform many of the functions that people look to crossovers to fulfill, like hauling long or odd-shaped cargo.\n\nThe A7's V6 engine uses a turbocharger this year, rather than a supercharger. Audi has upgraded the A7's drivetrain with a new all-wheel-drive system, and a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox replaces the outgoing eight-speed automatic.\n\nBecause of its price and shape, the Audi A7 competes with a range of premium and luxury four-doors. The [Mercedes-Benz E-Class](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-e+class), [Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-cls+class) and [BMW 5 Series](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-5+series), though they all lack the Audi's hatchback design. Buyers looking to save money might shop for the [Kia Stinger](https://www.autolist.com/kia-stinger), which also sports a similar hatchback design at a lower price point. The Kia also offers a turbocharged V6 engine, available all-wheel-drive, and long list of features.\n\nBuyers might also consider any number of the latest crop of SUV \"coupe\" models from BMW or Mercedes-Benz, such as the [X6](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-x6) or [GLE](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-gle) Coupe. These vehicles take a different approach to the blended vehicle look and may not handle as well, but offer more utility and all-weather capability.\n\n### Exterior\n\nTL;DR The Audi A7's unique shape and hatchback make it stand out in a crowded field of luxury sedan contenders.\n\n![2019-audi-a7-exterior-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/aQSVZX3r2lZEocK5vKoBO/7016dc1072a16df6245131b3eeff1f8a/2019-audi-a7-exterior-1.jpg)\n\nThe A7 has received a redesign for 2019, even if the overall shape is similar to the outgoing model. The new look includes sharper exterior styling but retains the model's signature four-door hatchback profile. All-around LED lighting is standard now, as are 19-inch, 10-spoke wheels. A Matrix LED headlight system that adjusts high beams around oncoming traffic and pedestrians is newly available.\n\nCritics praise the A7's sleek lines and sporty profile, noting that the sloping roofline and fastback shape stretches the overall visual appearance of the car. The hatchback, unusual for this type of vehicle, is more functional than a traditional trunk and allows for a larger space behind the back seats and easier loading of bulky items. The grille area has also been praised as blending the required radar and safety tech into a sleek look.\n\n![2019-audi-a7-exterior-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4pmNVdeVE6NXkPl9iHlKey/99196758113bececc15e43e0daf13c92/2019-audi-a7-exterior-2.jpg)\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nTL;DR The A7's lengthy stance ups interior space considerably, but the sweeping roofline will make taller rear-seat passengers feel cramped.\n\nWith seating for five people and upscale standard features, the A7 has won critics' praise for a top-notch interior. \n\n![2019-audi-a7-interior-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4q8MvCl2eeTicehyoQTSsl/07821877862e92930e56120501c21d2b/2019-audi-a7-interior-1.jpg)\n\nThe power steering wheel and seat adjustments are standard, as are heated front seats that can be upgraded to include ventilation. Front seat passengers enjoy generous legroom and an airy feel, thanks to plenty of headroom and large windows in front. Reviewers note that the high level of adjustment in the front seats makes it easy to find a comfortable position for both the driver and passenger. The front seats can also be optioned up to include a massage feature.\n\nThe A7's lengthy wheelbase affords plenty of legroom for rear-seat passengers, even taller ones. One notable drawback of the sloping roof is a reduction of rear-seat headroom, but large door openings make entry and exit relatively easy. People using child seats in the rear will find that the low roof makes loading and unloading the seats more difficult than in a traditional car or SUV. Reviewers praise the A7 for excellent outward visibility in the front and sides, but the small rear window makes visibility difficult out of the back. The low roofline impedes rearward visibility further.\n\n![2019-audi-a7-interior-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6WvTXhRgv0msZv3WMjwPDZ/713d028c4792f9f9bdd1ea565773190b/2019-audi-a7-interior-2.jpg)\n\nCritics note that the A7's cabin is sparse but refined, with a less busy interior than competing brands like Mercedes-Benz. The interior build and material quality is on par with competitors and should meet buyers' expectations of a vehicle in the luxury segment.\n\nThe A7 features a dual-touchscreen infotainment setup that now matches the systems found in other Audi models like the A6 and A8. Critics like the new system's interface, noting that it's easier to use than the previous car's single screen and rotary dial. The new system's displays are well-integrated with the dash and are easily visible in most light conditions. \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Utility & Practicality\n\nTL;DR The folding rear seats and hatchback give the A7 SUV-like capability in a sedan-sized package.\n\n![2019-audi-a7-exterior-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1LFyeLT48PjlTYHCSsbUOW/12846653e48f06b186152e826a830f6d/2019-audi-a7-exterior-3.jpg)\n\nThe A7's hatchback design gives it an advantage over more traditionally-shaped competitors in the cargo space category. There is 25 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats, placing the Audi at the top of its class. The rear seats fold, which significantly increases cargo space and usability, especially for longer items. Critics knock the A7's trunk space for being shallow but note that the folding seats help compensate for the lack of depth. A hands-free power liftgate comes as standard equipment, making the Audi much more like an SUV than its competitors.\n\n### Technology & Infotainment\n\nTL;DR Two screens are better than one in the A7. The new system is more intuitive and easier to use than the mix of physical and screen controls from previous models.\n\nThe 2019 refresh brought a new approach to infotainment for the A7. Two screens and a single row of touch-sensitive buttons operate nearly all of the navigation, audio and climate control functions. The only physical button now is the volume knob. \n\n![2019-audi-a7-interior-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4TpUCdwh36q1FZMzD2kOf5/504bd24aa11f5b1f389ded9dea701edd/2019-audi-a7-interior-3.jpg)\n\nThe top screen is a 10.1-inch display that is turned slightly toward the driver and handles things like audio and the standard navigation system. There's a lower display that measures 8.6 inches for climate controls and cabin settings like heated seats. \n\nReviewers note that the dual-screen system may require a bit more learning time than the previous design. But once the user is acclimated, it makes more sense than a mix of physical and screen controls. They also mention that the touchscreen is not as sensitive as users might expect and requires more pressure to activate than those from other manufacturers. \n\nSome testers deduct points for Audi's decision to split some controls between both screens, criticizing the need to select a menu on one screen and change the setting on the other.\n\nThe A7's infotainment system supports both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. New for 2019 is the addition of wireless Apple CarPlay, which reviewers like for its convenience and ease of use. Android Auto users will have to stick with USB connections for now. Testers also praise the A7's audio system for sounding great, even without the addition of the optional Bang and Olufsen stereo.\n\n### Safety & Driving Assistance\n\nTL;DR The A7 has earned good crash test ratings, but advanced driver assistance features are held back for higher trims.\n\nThe A7 is available with a wide array of advanced driver assist systems, but for the most part, they are only available on the two most expensive models. The Premium Plus and Prestige trim levels come with Audi's pre-sense 360 system, which uses 24 sensors, radar, cameras, and sonar to alert the driver and help avoid collisions. There's also a top-view camera system with a 360-degree view, adaptive cruise, rear cross-traffic alerts, pedestrian detection, and more. \n\nThe A7's standard features were strong enough to earn \"Good\" ratings from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) for front and side-impact protection, as well as roof strength and head restraints. The standard crash avoidance features earned the A7 a \"Superior\" rating. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has not yet rated the 2019 A7.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nTL;DR The new A7 is softer than before but retains a sporty attitude and comfortable ride.\n\nThose who have reviewed the A7 give it big points for its ability to mix sportiness, comfort, and utility. Despite being a large vehicle, the car is noted as being agile and composed. Reviewers do notice more body roll and movement when cornering due to Audi's increased focus on the A7's level of comfort. Some state that the car is more usable as an everyday driver because of this, making it more accessible for a larger group of buyers.\n\nThe only powertrain available for 2019 is a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 that makes 335 horsepower. It's mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and standard all-wheel-drive. Critics who have driven the car aggressively notice that turbo lag is very slight, and that power delivery is smooth. Throttle response is immediate, and the seven-speed gearbox is paired well with the engine to draw out as much power as possible. Audi has added a 48-volt mild hybrid system that is said to boost low-range power. The updated Quattro all-wheel-drive system can shift power between the front and rear wheels, or individually among them to optimize traction.\n\nThe A7 has four selectable driving modes: Auto, Comfort, Dynamic, and a custom mode that lets drivers configure settings as desired. Reviewers liked the Dynamic setting's sharper throttle response and better handling.\n\nTesters have clocked the A7 at a 0-60 mph time of less than five seconds, which is very close to the times that were recorded in the previous car. They note that, while the new gearbox is responsive and snappy, there's no noticeable improvement in performance over the old car's transmission.\n\n### Fuel efficiency\n\nTL;DR The A7's fuel economy numbers are competitive against the rest of the luxury sedan class, but Audi could've done more with the hybrid system.\n\nThe single powertrain in the A7 generates EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings of 22 mpg city, 29 mpg highway and 25 mpg combined. That is on par with others in its class. Critics knock the A7's mild hybrid system for not improving efficiency more, however.\n\n### Trim levels & Pricing\n\nTL;DR The A7's mid-range Premium Plus trim has top-notch features without topping out the price tag.\n\nThe 2019 Audi A7 has a starting MSRP of $68,975 with destination charge, and includes a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6, seven-speed automatic transmission, all-wheel-drive, a power panoramic sunroof, LED headlights, dual exhausts, 19-inch wheels, a power rear spoiler, leather upholstery, woodgrain interior accents, heated front seats, folding rear seats, an eight-way power-adjustable driver's seat, navigation, a power liftgate, cruise control, Bluetooth, and front and rear parking sensors\n\nThe __A7 Premium Plus__ has a starting price of $73,375 and comes with Audi's Virtual Cockpit system that displays maps and other information in the gauge cluster, HD-matrix LED headlights, as well as the Bang & Olufsen 3D Premium Sound System. A top-view 360-degree camera system, adaptive cruise control and other driver assistance features, and wireless smartphone charging are also included.\n\nThe __A7 Prestige__ has a starting price of $77,275 and adds a head-up display, ventilated front seats, LED/laser headlights, four-zone climate control, and soft-close doors.\n\n### Value \n\nTL;DR The A7's in a tough spot because of its price and competition.\n\nThe A7 sits in an odd place in the Audi lineup but earns its keep as an excellent performer with top-grade tech and comfort features. Critics have heaped praise on the car, placing it on many top-10 and \"must-buy\" lists. \n\nThe car's premium price slots it into direct competition with the [BMW 5-Serie](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-5+series)s and [Mercedes-Benz E-Class](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-e+class), both of which are less expensive and have much of the same technologies found in the Audi. However, those who like the style and more versatile design of the A7 may be convinced the price premium is worth it.\n\nIf we were buying an A7, our money would be spent on the mid-range Premium Plus trim. It gets the same tech and safety features as the range-topping Prestige trim while saving a few thousand dollars on the sticker price.\n\n### More Photos\n\nSee more [2019 Audi A7 Photos](https://www.autolist.com/audi-a7-2019/2019-audi-a7-photos).",

      "body": "Whenever you purchase a used or new vehicle, you can expect to pay more than the advertised price. In the case of a new car, some of this is dealer fees, but you will also pay various state and local taxes to finalize the purchase and register your vehicle. For a used vehicle, you'll need to pay sales tax and licensing fees to get the vehicle registered in your name. Here are some of the usual extra fees when buying a used or new vehicle.\n\n### Registration\n\nEvery state charges a registration fee to get the motor vehicle in your name. The costs vary by state. Sometimes they're flat fees, while other states base the fee on various factors like the vehicle's weight, age or worth. Most states also have fees and penalties if you don't register the vehicle within a certain amount of time after the sale date.\n\n### License Plates\n\nThe cost of new plates might be part of your registration fee, or it might be a separate cost. Some states let you take your old plates from a car you sold and put them on the new vehicle. Other states require brand new plates upon transferring ownership.\n\n### Title Transfer\n\nWhen you buy a car from a dealer or private party, you'll have to transfer the title from them into your name. Naturally, there's a fee to do this that varies by state.\n\n### Lien Recording\n\nIf you take out a loan to buy a vehicle, the DMV might add a lien recording fee to your costs.\n\n### Documentation Fee\n\nThat is a fee usually charged by car dealerships to write up all the paperwork in buying a vehicle. Several states have a maximum amount in place that the dealer can charge for this.\n\n### Sales Tax\n\nMost states require sales tax in the purchase of a vehicle. However, this tax amount often varies by city or county. You will typically pay the sales tax of the county or city that you live. For example, if your state sales tax is six percent, but you register the vehicle in a county that has a ten percent tax rate, then you will pay ten percent tax.\n\n### Personal Property Tax\n\nSome states also require a personal property tax based on vehicle value. It is usually an annual fee, and rates vary by state.\n\n### Emissions and Inspections\n\nSome states require emissions tests or inspections upon transferring ownership from one party to another.\n\n### Hybrid and Electric Vehicles\n\nBecause owners of these vehicles don't pay much in fuel taxes, some states charge specific fees for buying these vehicles.\n\n### Let's take a look at the vehicle registration, tax and title fees on a state by state basis.\n\n__Alabama__\n\nAlabama charges $15-23 for initial registration, plus $50 annually.

      "body": "### Top 10 Used Car Websites    \n\nBuying a new or used vehicle is a big decision — both financially and in terms of the amount of time we spend in our cars. And wouldn’t you know it, there’s an app for that.  \n\nWhether you're looking for a cheap compact car, a dependable work truck or a large luxury SUV, you can find it online these days. You don’t even need to leave your couch to research, browse, inquire and finance your next vehicle. \n\nHere are some of the best used-car websites around.\n\n[__Autolist.com__](https://www.autolist.com)\nBecause it’s an aggregator (like Kayak.com), the easy-to-use Autolist site displays millions of vehicles from many different sources. Users can view details such as the length of time a given vehicle has been on the market, plus any price changes for that vehicle. Autolist has one of the highest-rated used-car apps available: it works with Android or iOS phones, and just like the website, it checks multiple online databases to help you locate your dream car. The app also has instant price-drop alerts and high-res picture to help you find the best deals on the most local listings. Shoppers can even apply for financing. With family sharing, as many as six family members can share information through the app. Add to this reviews, industry insights, a Rotten Tomatoes-style aggregator of older vehicle reviews and buyers guides to help steer you through the car-buying process.\n\n[Go to Autolist](https://www.autolist.com)\n\n![shutterstock 427841161 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5L2aWGxVPmUJjRqZS8tT9j/4ca1e2fa6255bb7a495569345d784315/shutterstock_427841161__1_.jpg)\n\n__Autotrader.com__\nBecause AutoTrader has been around since before the internet, its longstanding reputation has built up decades of trust. With over 3 million listings drawn from 40,000 dealers and 250,000 private sellers, their selection is immense. The website has a wide variety of filters that can help you narrow your search down to exactly the type of vehicle you’re looking for. You can save your searches and even apply for insurance and a loan.\n\n__Edmunds.com__\nLike Autotrader, Edmunds originated as a paperback booklet available at newsstands. Decades of experience has made this a well-respected name in the industry. The website allows you to save your searches and favorites and also lets you filter your selections. Although their search appears to be similar to the ones available on other sites, they often have more features and options to choose from. This allows you to narrow and refine more thoroughly. Edmunds also has a wealth of advice and articles to help educate you about the car-buying process and the vehicles themselves.  \n\n__EnterpriseCarSales.com__\nIf you don't mind a car with plenty of miles on it, Enterprise's former rentals can be a good choice. They offer a no-questions-asked, seven-day “buyer’s remorse” period, in addition to their 12-month or 12,000-mile limited powertrain warranty and one year of roadside assistance. Enterprise also provides their own financing. Unlike most of the other sites mentioned here, Enterprise also sells cars only from one source: their own retired rental fleets. They take trade-ins and they have special programs for college graduates or first-time car buyers. The website allows you to search by the monthly payment you can afford alongside the same criteria you’ll find on other sites.\n\n__Autotempest.com__\nLike some of the other websites here, Autotempest’s search results are drawn from multiple sources, and their website and app work similarly to the others as well (including the ability to save your searches). They also have tons of other useful information as well, including an up-to-date blog, buying guides and car reviews. While you can filter your searches, the criteria for doing so are much more limited – although some might consider it to be streamlined: Either way, the most important information is provided. Choices include make, model, distance, price, year, mileage, type of vehicle, transmission and whether they’re for sale privately or by a dealer.\n\n![shutterstock 329553065 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6l792PAl1ZQfXNxVGYKeCc/38e2f7ec44a5f012de0ecd746fb7af8e/shutterstock_329553065__1_.jpg) \n\n\n__Kbb.com (Kelley Blue Book site)__\nThe words \"Blue Book price\" have been a part of the American vernacular for nearly a century, and the Kelley Blue Book website and app both trade on this longstanding name recognition. Not only are they known for providing accurate estimates of your car's value, but their site has tools for checking your credit score and calculating car payments too. Expert reviews, top ten lists and recall postings make this site a longtime go-to favorite for automotive information. They also cover motorcycles, snowmobiles and personal watercraft such as jet skis. Kelley even has an instant cash offer section on their website.\n\n__CarGurus.com__\nThis is a company which seeks to build trust through transparency. On their website, you will find many of the same search options as you’ll find on the other sites. However, on top of this, you’ll also find the Car Guru valuation of a given vehicle based on typical search criteria. Similar to methods used by KBB, the information they use to make this determination includes comparable car listings in addition to those which have recently sold.  Ratings are based on mileage, trim, vehicle history, and a multitude of other factors. Car Gurus rates each available car deal as being overpriced, high, fair, good, or great.\n\n__Hemmings.com__\nFor classic car, truck or motorcycle collectors, this is a ‘don’t-miss’ destination. In addition to vehicles, Hemmings helps you locate hard-to-find parts for your project cars. Search for vehicles or parts by make, model, type, price range and category.  With more of a community feel to it, this site maintains a blog and regularly sends out newsletters. Hemmings also sells merchandise related to this niche market. They have an email list, fantastic videos and special events, not to mention apps for Android and iOS, and a number of print publications you can subscribe to.\n\n![shutterstock 1301070901 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4DXmUcxSFvmDO9eO8DQ3v9/f9778fe77386725e77248954d4f929fd/shutterstock_1301070901__1_.jpg) \n\n__Carsdirect.com__\nThis site works to simplify the process of buying a car, and like Autotrader and Autolist, they can help you with auto financing. The search criteria include make, model, distance, price, mileage, year, color, transmission and fuel type, engine, CARFAX and a few others like leather, photo availability and navigation. CarsDirect also has buying guides, rankings, and vehicle comparisons. Like similar sites, you can save your searches and vehicles of interest, and the website also has educational videos including reviews, car news and reports as well as tools including a trade-in valuation provided by Black Book. \n\n__Craigslist.org__\nPrimarily a classified site, craigslist doesn't have a lot of fancy graphics or options, but the site’s selection is fairly broad and postings do include photos. You'll need to be super savvy if you're going this route, because the internet is rife with scammers, but it is possible to negotiate a worthwhile deal from Craigslist. Search filters here include distance, price, make and model, year, mileage, condition, number of cylinders, drive train and fuel type, color, size, title status, vehicle type and transmission type. A point of interest to some, some sellers on Craigslist might accept cryptocurrency in exchange for the vehicle they’re selling. You can also create email alerts for the specific attributes of a vehicle that you’re looking for. ",

      "body": "When you’re in the market for a car, there are several options to consider for how to pay for it, with the two primary choices being lease or buy. Each has its upsides and downsides and factors like how much you use your car and what for, as well as how long you plan to keep your vehicle will help determine whether you are better off going with a lease or just buying. \n\nLeasing allows you to enjoy the use of a car without owning it. In this case, you only pay for the depreciation that occurs over the term of the lease, plus fees and interest. However, there are some reasons why it may make more sense for you to own your vehicle outright by buying it.\n\n## Financial Considerations\n\n![shutterstock 1408746653 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6UdAklZlrftPWXBJpcjGJE/602b977b57b8f5fee706035eb8f51252/shutterstock_1408746653__1_.jpg)\n\n__Down Payment__\nWhether you lease or buy, the down payment may be as low as zero, but the lower your down payment is, the higher your monthly payments will be. Also, most leases with zero down payment are only offered to those who have excellent credit.\n\n__Interest__\nLease: You only pay interest on the difference between the capitalized cost (the actual price of the vehicle you've negotiated plus any fees and taxes on the vehicle) and the vehicle’s residual value (what it's expected to be worth at the end of the lease).\n\nBuy: You pay interest on the entire amount of money you borrow, which includes the cost of the car and sometimes add-ons like maintenance plans or warranties.\n\n__Mileage__\nLease: Leases have strict mileage limits, which can get expensive. Many leases charge you per mile for every mile you go over the limit; excess mileage charges can be anywhere from 15 to 30 cents or more per mile. While the automakers or dealers dictate the number of miles you can drive per year, they don’t check annually to ensure that you’re under the limit -- so it's up to you to keep track. \n\nThe total allowed mileage is calculated by taking the number of years and multiplying it by the number of annual miles allowed. Since this total number of miles is priced into the lease, if you are way *under* the mileage limit when you return the vehicle, you’ve essentially paid for miles you didn’t use. \n\nBuy: When you own a car, you have no mileage limitations, but if you drive a lot, you may exhaust the warranty early. Nevertheless, if you drive a lot, buying a car often makes better financial sense than leasing. \n\n__Monthly Payments__\nBecause you’re paying for the depreciation that occurs during the term of a lease, monthly payments are usually lower with a lease than they are when you buy and used a financed loan. \n\nThis often means that if you lease, you can get a nicer, larger or newer vehicle -- or one with a few extra options on it -- than you would have been able to afford if you were buying. It also means you can save more money by leasing the same vehicle you were considering buying. \n\n__Ownership__\nLease: You are not the owner of your car, you just pay for the right to use it, like when you rent an apartment. The vehicle is owned by the company that holds the title, often the automaker itself. If the vehicle is totaled or stolen, the leasing company is paid off, but then you’ll need to go lease or finance another car.\n\nHowever, most leases do offer you the option to buy the vehicle for a set price at the end of the lease term. \n\nBuy: If you purchase a car for cash, you own it outright, and therefore can do with it as you please. If you’ve taken out a loan, your vehicle’s title will be held by the lender until it is paid off, at which time you own it free and clear. \n\n![shutterstock 1463009087 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1RaA0k1aseBIWTmoO9UEI3/37bd0cae865bc1046ef7018ca8f1aef2/shutterstock_1463009087__1_.jpg)\n\n__Sales Tax__\nLease: In some cases, you only pay tax on the amount you put down and on your monthly payments. In others, you pay sales tax on the entire value of the car just as you would if you were buying it. This usually depends on the state where you buy the vehicle, so check with your dealer. \n\nBuy: Purchasers pay tax on the entire cost of the vehicle minus the value of any trade-in, in most states. \n\n__Trading In__\nWhen your lease is up, you simply return the car to the dealership and pay any final fees, including any charges for excess mileage or wear and tear. You can then lease or purchase another car, with little to no hassle.  As we mentioned, most leases do offer you the option to buy that car at that time if you've become attached to it or your finances are better suited to owning.\n\nIf you own your car, you have to sell it yourself or get a fair trade-in price for it, which may take much longer and involve more work on your part.\n\n__Warranty Coverage and Maintenance__\nLease: Unless you put a lot of miles on it or lease a used vehicle, the manufacturer's warranty covers it for the entire term of the lease, since that term is just a few years. What's more, some leases even include maintenance such as oil changes and air filters – even tires – as part of the agreement. This gives you a more predictable cost of ownership, reducing unexpected out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nBuy: New-car bumper-to-bumper and powertrain warranties vary in length so depending on how long yours is and how long you plan on owning the car, it's possible your warranty will expire before you sell your car.\n\n## Other Considerations\n\n__Changing Your Mind__\nWhen you sign a lease, you’re usually locked into that contract for the length of the lease. When you buy your car, you can keep it for as long as you like. If you decide that it’s just not really what you want – for whatever reason – you can sell it. You can also refinance a loan, but renegotiating a lease is more difficult.     \n\n__Customization__\nNo matter how much you might think changes to it enhance the vehicle’s value, your lease papers state that the car must be returned just as it was when delivered to you, minus normal wear and tear. However, when you own it, you can alter the car as much as you'd like. Your changes may even add value to the vehicle or at least allow you to break even when you eventually sell it.\n\n__Usage Restrictions__\nLease agreements can have strict limitations regarding where you drive your car and what you can use it for -- particularly commercial use. Because of this, if you’re planning to use your vehicle for anything other than what's considered normal use, be sure to find out beforehand whether it's is allowed. \n\nThis is not a concern when you own the car.\n\n## Summary\n![shutterstock 1378026344 (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5KZJO2MtPvp2ylVMUebGMo/8e37c98d87497730f501df3fc44afc92/shutterstock_1378026344__1_.jpg)\n\nTo recap, leasing is a great option because it gives you flexibility. This matters if you like to change cars every couple of years, if you would like a nicer car than buying will allow given your financial state or if your needs for a vehicle will change in the near future (like having kids or moving to an area where you'll need all-wheel-drive). \n\nOwning is ideal if you want to keep your vehicle for an extended period of time, if you plan on putting a lot of miles on your vehicle, use it for something that might be prohibited within the terms of a lease contract, such as rideshare driving, or simply like the idea of building up equity in your vehicle that you can then capitalize on later.

      "body": "It's becoming more challenging to find new vehicles with manual transmissions as automatic transmissions become more common. The manual transmission was typically standard in a wide variety of vehicles, from sports cars to sedans to SUVs. So what are some of the best manual cars under $10,000?\n\n### Ford Focus\n\nThe Ford Focus was in production from 1999 until 2018 over three generations in the United States. As a used car, it's available as a hatchback, wagon, sedan, or coupe – and all were available with a manual transmission at some point. Most Focus models came with four-cylinder engines. As an example, you can find a used 2012 Focus for prices ranging from $5,000 to $8,000 depending on mileage, location and options.\n\n[Manual Ford Focus for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/ford-focus#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n### Subaru Impreza\n\nAnother compact car, the Impreza has been in production since 1992. During its lifetime, the Impreza has been available in body styles such as a coupe, sedan, wagon and hatchback. And all Imprezas have offered both automatic and manual transmissions, with most also featuring all-wheel-drive as standard equipment, rare among compact cars. The Impreza keeps its value pretty well, so you'll have to look between model years 2008 and 2011 to find one under $10,000 with reasonable miles.\n\n[Manual Subaru Impreza for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/subaru-impreza#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n### Mazda 3\n\nProduced as a sedan and a hatchback, the Mazda 3 has been available since 2003. All four generations have offered manual transmissions paired with four-cylinder engines. Like the Impreza, the Mazda 3 has substantial resale value, and you'll likely have to go back past model year 2012 to find them priced for less than $10,000.\n\n[Manual Mazda 3 for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-mazda3#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n### Acura TSX\n\nThe TSX was Acura's entry-level premium sedan between 2003 and 2014. It primarily came in a four-door sedan version with also a limited amount of station wagons produced. All generations had available manual transmissions and the engine size varied from a four-cylinder to a V6, but the manual was only available for four-cylinder sedan models. Even though the TSX is no longer in production, it's not too difficult to find models for under $10,000 in price. The sweet spot seems to be between 2004 and 2008.\n\n[Manual Acura TSX for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/acura-tsx#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n### Volkswagen GTI\n\nThe GTI is a performance version of the Golf, and there's no doubt that the little hatchback is fun to drive, and especially with a manual transmission. Despite its small size, it's surprisingly roomy inside. There is a decent selection of Volkswagen GTIs between model years 2009 and 2014 for less than $10,000.\n\n[Manual Volkswagen GTI for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/volkswagen-golf+gti#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Honda Accord\n\nOne of the most popular cars ever made, the Accord has been around since 1976 as both a compact and midsize car. The eighth generation of Accord was sold from 2008 until 2013 and is available as a used car for under $10,000. It also came with a manual transmission in sedan and coupe formats, with either four or six-cylinder power.\n\n[Manual Honda Accord for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n### Mazda Miata\n\nThe Miata is a sporty little convertible that has been in production since 1989 and is currently in its fourth generation. The small Mazda is only a two-seater, so it's often referred to as a roadster or sports car. It only comes with a four-cylinder engine, and many were ordered with the standard manual transmission. Currently, it's relatively easy to find a Miata produced between 2000 and 2010 for less than $10,000, especially as the original 1990s models rise in value. \n\n[Manual Mazda Miata for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-mx+5+miata#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n### Toyota Corolla\n\nLike the Accord, the Corolla has been around for a long time, since 1966, and is well-known for being dependable transportation. Brand new, the Corolla has a price range between $16,800 and $21,300, so it's not difficult to find used models under $10,000. You might be able to find some as new as 2014, but in general, you'll be looking older than 2011. That year range generally came in a four-cylinder with available manual transmissions, but you'll have to look hard as most Corollas were ordered with automatics.\n\n[Manual Toyota Corolla for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-corolla#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n### Honda Fit\n\nThe Honda Fit is another compact car that was relatively inexpensive new, with an MSRP topping out around $21,000. If you look at model years between 2009 and 2013, it shouldn't be too hard to find some for under $10,000. The Fit is a hatchback powered by a four-cylinder engine and offers both manual and automatic transmissions.\n\n[Manual Honda Fit for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/honda-fit#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n### Chevrolet Sonic\n\nThe Sonic has been in production since 2011 as a hatchback and sedan. It comes with a four-cylinder engine, including a turbo version, and available with manual and automatic transmissions. While brand new versions can sticker for more than $20,000, it's not too hard to find one under $10,000 from about the 2016 model year and older.\n\n[Manual Chevrolet Sonic for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-sonic#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n### BMW 3 Series\n\nThe BMW 3 Series was introduced in 1977 and quickly became a popular choice for those looking for a small sports coupe or sedan. Both four and six-cylinder engines have been available over the years, with turbocharged versions becoming increasingly prevalent. Manual transmissions used to be reasonably common, too, a rarity for a luxury brand. Versions from as recently as 2014 are starting to fall below the $10,000 mark.\n\n[Manual BMW 3 Series for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-3+series#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n### Honda Civic\n\nNot only is the Honda Civic one of the most popular small cars ever, but it has a deserved reputation of being one of the most well-rounded. Available over the years as a sedan, coupe and hatchback, the Civic has been around for a long time, and it's easy to find model years that cost less than $10,000 – many of which have manual transmissions. Look for models as recently as 2015.\n\n[Manual Honda Civic for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n### Chevrolet Corvette\n\nBelieve it or not, you can find certain generations of the quintessential American sports car in the Corvette for under 10 grand. You'll mainly want to look at the C4 generation, which was made between model years 1984 and 1996. These classic rear-wheel-drive cars are likely to have over 100,000 miles on them, and many were automatics, but there are still some with manual transmissions out there. If you're not worried about fuel economy, then it's hard to resist a V8 sports car under $10,000.\n\n[Manual Chevrolet Corvette for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n### Porsche Boxster\n\nThe early Boxsters may be beginning to look a bit dated compared to the most recent versions, but they represent a lot of value for less than $10,000. They may not be turbocharged, but models from 1997 through 2000 offer the company's classic six-cylinder format and many feature manual transmissions, with more prestige than a Mazda Miata.\n\n[Manual Porsche Boxster for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/porsche-boxster#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n### Audi S4\n\nAnother high-performance car, the 2004 S4 can be found for under $10,000 if you're willing to do some hunting. This car comes with a 4.2-liter V8 with 340 horsepower, as well as a standard all-wheel-drive system and available manual transmissions.\n\n[Manual Audi S4 for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/audi-s4#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Chevrolet Camaro\n\nIf you're still looking for iconic sports cars, then don't forget about the Camaro. Thanks to the car's hiatus after the fourth generation, it's pretty easy to find it for under $10,000. That generation was made between 1992 and 2002, and it came in both V6 and V8 engines with available manual transmissions.\n\n[Manual Chevrolet Camaro for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-camaro#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n### Infiniti G35 Coupe\n\nThe G35 was produced between 2003 and 2008. The coupe version was a sporty and quick version with a six-cylinder engine and available manual transmission and shares many pieces with the Nissan 350Z sports coupe – but with more interior space and luxury features. It's easy to find one under $10,000 in price.\n\n[Manual Infiniti G35 Coupe for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/infiniti-g35#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n### Subaru Outback\n\nIf you're looking for a reliable all-around vehicle with decent gas mileage, roomy interior, all-wheel-drive and manual transmission, then a used Outback might be a perfect choice. With lots of space for five passengers and cargo and a reputation for durability, Outbacks hold their value well, especially in snowy parts of the country. You'll generally be looking at vehicles older than 2011 and mileage is likely to be over 100,000.\n\n[Manual Subaru Outback for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/subaru-outback#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n### Nissan Xterra\n\nIt's becoming much harder to find SUVs and trucks with manual transmissions, but the Xterra offered one during its production from 2000 until 2015. While the last few years of the Xterra are still hovering over $10,000 in many cases, if you look around 2011 and older, you should be able to find them at a reasonable price.\n\n[Manual Nissan Xterra for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-xterra#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n### Kia Soul\n\nThe Soul is a subcompact SUV produced since 2010 over two generations. Both generations have offered manual transmissions, and anything older than 2015 is generally priced under or around $10,000. They're uncommon, though, and most lack the upscale amenities of models with automatic transmissions. But the Soul is a quirky, versatile vehicle that is relatively economical and inexpensive to run.\n\n[Manual Kia Soul for Sale](https://www.autolist.com/kia-soul#transmission%5B%5D=manual&price_max=10000&radius=500)\n\n### The Popularity of Manual Transmissions\n\nAs of 2018, cars with manual transmissions account for only 2% of all vehicles sold. In 2006, nearly half of all new models in the United States were offered with both automatics and manuals, but now it's down to only 20% and dropping quickly. The reason isn't too hard to understand. With more people driving, most want something easy to use and convenient. The majority of manuals today are found either in sports cars, whose drivers still like to feel at one with the road, and small commuter cars to make them less expensive. Very few SUVs or pickups have them anymore, with notable exceptions in the Toyota Tacoma, Nissan Frontier and Jeep Wrangler. \n\n### Pros and Cons of Manuals\n\nThe main con of a manual transmission is the learning curve. With an automatic, you simply put it into drive and go. A manual usually has five or six forward to select as driving conditions dictate, and you'll need to use the clutch each time you shift. Newer automatics also have more than six gears or a continuously variable setup that maximizes fuel economy, something that was traditionally an advantage for the manual transmission.\n\nOn the other hand, manual transmissions have fewer moving parts than an automatic and thus typically last longer with fewer breakdowns. The clutch is the main part that needs to be replaced, but models that have been well maintained and not driven too aggressively can go about 100,000 miles before clutch repair. \n\nAnother plus of a manual vehicle is that it forces you to pay closer attention to driving due to having to shift consistently. In an era of smartphones and other distractions, this can be invaluable to some people.",

      "body": "### Pros:\n\n - Wide range of engine options, trim and features  \n - Distinctive interior and exterior styling  \n - Numerous standard safety features  \n\n### Cons:\n\n - Infotainment screen criticized for smoothness  \n - Only average cargo and passenger room  \n - Simple interior functions are operated through overcomplicated menus  \n\n### Summary \n\nThe 2019 Volvo S60 is a compact luxury sedan that has been completely redesigned this year, now in its third iteration.\n\nThe Volvo competes with vehicles such as the [Audi A4](https://www.autolist.com/audi-a4), [Alfa Romeo Guilia](https://www.autolist.com/alfa+romeo-giulia), [Genesis G70](https://www.autolist.com/genesis-g70), [Mercedes Benz C-Class](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-c+class), [BMW 3 Series](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-3+series), [Infiniti Q50](https://www.autolist.com/infiniti-q50), [Jaguar XE](https://www.autolist.com/jaguar-xe), [Tesla Model 3](https://www.autolist.com/tesla-model+3), and [Lexus IS](https://www.autolist.com/lexus-is+250).  \n\nBorrowing features from other recent Volvo designs, the 2019 S60 has completely revised technology and safety features, some of which are options on competing vehicles. Apple CarPlay and Android now come standard along with automatic emergency braking. Other significant options include a plug-in hybrid system and Volvo's Pilot Assist system, an advanced driver assistance feature.\n\nA wide variety of options help the new S60 cater to a wide range of people. Similar in design and features to the larger S90, the S60 still offers all-wheel-drive and three different engine options. A wagon version called the Volvo V60 and covered separately. \n\n### Exterior  \n\nTLDR: The S60 is widely regarded as one of the best looking vehicles on the market, similar to other Volvo models. \n\nThe S60 is easily identified as part of the Volvo family. It closely resembles its larger S90 sibling but in a more compact package. Many reviewers consider it as one of the most handsome vehicles in its class.  \n\n![2019-volvo-s60-exterior-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3H9O5z96EuYHAcpWDRDTNi/5270e90d5e9ea090432fcc8bbcbeedac/2019-volvo-s60-exterior-1.jpg)\n\nThe front features Volvo's indented grille design with its logo prominently displayed through the middle. Its headlights are one of the vehicle's more striking features with a signature LED running light bisecting each. No features are disproportionately large, and dimensions are reasonable.  \n\nThe rear of the vehicle features wrap-around taillights that follow the edge of the trunk then protrude toward the middle. They are sharp and form a stylish \"C\" on either side of the vehicle. Dual exhaust outlets add a sleek and sporty touch.  \nThe side profile displays a perfect example of a small sedan. A long hood flows into a roofline that does not taper too quickly in the rear like many modern sedans. A lack of overly fussy character lines makes the S60 look elegant, and the back of the vehicle comes to a point where the trunk ends, making it look athletic.  \n\n![2019-volvo-s60-exterior-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/66JBKeoDvHN3XtZDOhtdCh/1e2cdce975bfca9d481ca4f74555e781/2019-volvo-s60-exterior-2.jpg)\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort \n\nTLDR: Quality and comfort are both excellent with a simple and elegant interior, quiet ride, and use of quality materials.  \n\nInterior quality and comfort are both good for the class. Reviewers note the interior to be clean, simple, and uncluttered. Quality materials can be found throughout though most testers agree that comparable Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz models fall into a slightly higher overall quality level than the S60.  \n\n![2019-volvo-s60-interior-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1tiQ725USIaAH9DFpAXySU/aaf3390225364dc76299d75022dc8d64/2019-volvo-s60-interior-1.jpg)\n\nThe seats and the comfort they impart to passengers is a highlight noted by nearly all testers. Leatherette upholstery comes standard on the base trim, while leather is offered on the other two. The seats are supportive, and four average-sized adults can fit comfortably in the vehicle.  \n\nSome taller testers find the back seats cramped, especially when it comes to headroom. The middle seat should mainly be reserved for smaller passengers. Rear legroom is acceptable for the class, but others in the segment offer more, according to reviewers.  \n\nRoad noise is noted by reviewers to be average, and engine noise is indicated to be surprisingly present at times during acceleration.  \n\n![2019-volvo-s60-interior-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3dNeLhIsJPYES3qAWcxfJP/7b2ebfcd030484fa0813eb21c19f06d6/2019-volvo-s60-interior-2.jpg)\n\nDespite the refined, classy, and clean interior, most reviewers note that cabin ergonomics suffer because of the touchscreen display. Many interior features like climate controls must be adjusted via the touchscreen, and many reviewers find the controls to be slow to respond and frustrating to use.  \n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Utility & Practicality \n\nTLDR: Cargo and passenger capacity are only average for the class with taller reviewers being slightly cramped in the rear seats.  \n\nThe S60 is wider than many of its competitors, which allows the trunk to be easily accessible even though it's ultimately short. Cargo capacity is only average for the class at 11.6 cubic feet. Folding rear seats increase storage space when needed, while small-item storage space in the cabin is adequate.  \n\n![2019-volvo-s60-exterior-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/fOgTSldDrBWZw51hzzfem/77cf9fd5ecae4a0cb5147c91b53de411/2019-volvo-s60-exterior-3.jpg)\n\nAll-wheel-drive adds poor weather capability, but the standard front-wheel-drive setup offers better traction than most rear-wheel-drive rivals.\n\nReviewers have no trouble getting into the vehicle, though some taller reviewers have to duck slightly to clear the roof. Some reviewers note that the rear wheel arch can hinder rear seat entry in tighter parking spots.  \n\nVisibility is a noted high point for most reviewers. Nearly all are pleased with the amount of adjustability the driver's seat has to offer, and the seating position is good. The lack of a high beltline, the availability of parking aids, and a small C-pillar all help.  \n\nLATCH child seat anchors are easy to find and use, according to reviewers.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Technology & Infotainment  \n\nTLDR: Technology features make a good showing while the infotainment system is not loved my most reviewers.\n\nThe number of standard technology and infotainment features is another S60 strong point, but many reviewers find some systems to be generally lacking compared to the competition.\n\nThe Sensus infotainment system comes on all S60s and is a vertically-oriented 9-inch touchscreen. Many note the system is difficult to use and frustrating at times, given that nearly all the infotainment and vehicle settings must be controlled through it.  \n\n![2019-volvo-s60-interior-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2ejY1pxgAbOdcSmUc6WZNi/0b153e96a0379fc61fdba2ca91b27abe/2019-volvo-s60-interior-3.jpg)\n\nOther standard infotainment features include Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Bluetooth, satellite radio, and a ten-speaker audio system. Options include a 13-speaker Harman Kardon sound system, a 15-speaker Bowers and Wilkins audio system, navigation, and a 12.3-inch configurable TFT instrument panel.  \n\nStandard technology features include a rearview camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, a power driver's seat with memory functions, power-folding rear headrests, and automatic windshield wipers.  \n\nOptions include a hands-free power trunk lid, head-up display, top-down 360-degree parking camera, four-zone climate control, ventilated front seats with massage, and Volvo's Pilot Assist semi-autonomous driving system.  \n\n### Safety & Driving Assistance  \n\nTLDR: Safety and driving assistance features remain a top priority at Volvo. The S60 excels in both areas. \n\nThe S60 comes standard with a host of safety and driver assistance features, continuing Volvo's tradition of producing some of the safest vehicles on the road.  \nStandard safety features include lane keep assist, road sign recognition, a rearview camera, driver drowsiness warning system, run-off road mitigation system, and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection and forward collision warning.  \n\nOptional features include blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive headlights, and automatic high-beam headlights.  \n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and National Highway Transportation Safety Administration both award the S60 top marks in crash tests. The IIHS also awards the highest Superior rating for its host of driver assistance features.  \n\n### Driving Experience \n\nTLDR: The S60 has pleasant all-around driving dynamics and an extensive choice of engines.  \n\nThe S60 is a well-mannered vehicle to drive, according to testers. Many note that its ride is slightly more cushy that many other competitors which hinder its ultimate performance potential. Most still agree that the car is competent and that athleticism is not a top priority for the class.  \n\nThe Volvo S60 is available with three powertrain options, all paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission.  \n\nT5 models come with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder turbocharged engine that produces 250 horsepower and 258 lb.-ft. of torque. The T5 is only available with a front-wheel-drive.\n\nThe T6 comes with an upgraded 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder engine that produces 316 horsepower and 295 lb.-ft. of torque. All-wheel-drive comes standard with this engine.\n\nT8 models designate the plug-in hybrid powertrain. This setup comes with the T6's gasoline engine and pairs to a 10.4-kilowatt electric motor. Total engine output is 400 horsepower and 472 lb.-ft. of torque.\n\nMost reviewers agree that the drivetrain of the S60 is one of the best engine and transmission combinations in the class. Transmission shifting is noted to be seamless and responsive, while reviewers say each engine option provides satisfying power and acceleration – especially on T8-equipped models.\n\nA sport suspension is available on the sporty R-Design trim, but reviewers note the standard setups to be smooth. Comfort is more of a priority than performance, but many are pleasantly surprised with the S60's cornering ability and good steering feel.  \n\nAcceleration is very good, with the all-wheel-drive T8 pushing the S60 to 60 miles per hour in under 5 seconds and the base T5 at just over 6. Braking is also good with a stopping distance of 105 feet from 60 mph under optimal conditions. Reviewers note that brake feel is confidence-inspiring and even throughout the pedal travel.  \n\nOverall, reviewers note that the combination of performance, handling, and comfort is unrivaled in the class. The S60 is not the fastest nor the most athletic small sedan in the class, but it does provide enough of everything to make most people happy.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Fuel efficiency  \n\nTLDR: Fuel efficiency is well above average, and a hybrid powertrain option adds additional market opportunities. \n\nThe S60's fuel efficiency is at the top of the class when opting for the base T5 engine. This front-wheel-drive variant returns EPA estimates of 24 mpg in the city and 36 mpg on the highway. A combined rating of 28 is one of the best in the class.  \n\nMoving to the all-wheel-drive T6 drops fuel economy numbers to 21 city and 32 highway, and a combined score of 25 mpg. Still, that is better than average when compared to rivals with six-cylinder engines of similar power.\n\nThe S60 T8 offers a 31 mpg combined rating with an all-electric range of around 20 miles. It also qualifies for some federal tax credit incentives for plug-in vehicles.\n\n### Trim Levels & Pricing \n\nTLDR: The base S60 offers a generous amount of standard features, while all versions offer extensive trim and feature choices.  \n\nAll Volvo S60 models come standard with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The base model T5 S60 is only available in front-wheel-drive while both the T6 and T8 models come standard with all-wheel-drive. All models come with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that produces varying power outputs depending on the choice of powertrain, but the T8 isn't available on the base Momentum model.  \n\nThe Volvo S60 is available in three trim levels:  \n\n__Volvo S60 Momentum:__\n\nThe S60 Momentum starts at $38,500, including the $995 destination charge. Momentum trim is available with both the T5 and T6 engines, with the T6 adding roughly $5,000 to the base price.\n\nStandard features include 18-inch wheels, a panoramic sunroof, LED headlights, dual-zone automatic climate control, a power driver seat with memory functions, leatherette upholstery and power-folding rear headrests. Also included is the Sensus infotainment system with a 9-inch vertical touchscreen display, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Bluetooth and a 10-speaker sound system with satellite radio.  \n\nSafety features include rain-sensing windshield wipers, automatic headlights, lane keep assist, a rearview camera, driver drowsiness warning system, run-off road mitigation system, as well as automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection and forward collision warning.\n\nSeveral optional packages are available for the Momentum trim. \n\nThe Premium Package adds a power hands-free trunk lid and a proximity key. It also includes blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking and front and rear parking sensors.  \n\nThe Advanced Package adds adaptive cornering headlights, Pilot Assist, adaptive cruise control, a top-down 360-degree camera, LED foglights, and a heads-up display.  \n\nThe Multimedia Package adds an upgraded 12.3-inch instrument display, built-in navigation, and a 13-speaker Harman Kardon audio system.  \n\nHeated front seats and a heated steering wheel are also available for T5 models, while heated rear seats are included in T6 Momentum models. \n\n__Volvo S60 R-Design:__  \n\nThe S60 T5 R-Design starts at $42,895. The T5 engine option comes. The T6 R-Design adds $4,500 to the price while the T8 R-Design adds $12,500 to the base model's sticker.  \n\nStandard features on the R-Design include everything from both the Multimedia and Premium packages available on the Momentum trim as well as special interior and exterior accents, LED foglights, sport steering wheel, leather seats with textile inserts, and steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters.  \n\nThe Advanced Package and heated seat options from the Momentum are available for the R-Design. Other extras include Volvo's Sport Chassis, a 15-speaker Bowers and Wilkins premium audio system, and an automated parking system.  \n\n__Volvo S60 Inscription:__  \n\nThe S60 Inscription starts at $43,895 with the destination fee included. T6 and T8 engine options are all available, adding the same premium as they do on the R-Design. An S60 T8 Inscription starts at $56,395 before options.  \n\nStandard equipment on the Inscription includes everything from the base Momentum trim and the Multimedia and Premium packages. Also included is four-zone automatic climate control, full leather upholstery, 10-way power-adjustable front seats with memory settings, wood interior trim, and LED foglights.  \n\nHeated seating remains an optional extra on the Inscription. The Luxury Seating Package includes Nappa leather upholstery, massaging front seats, and ventilated front seats. Other extras include adaptive suspension and the 15-speaker Bowers and Wilkins premium audio system.\n\n### Value  \n\nTLDR: The S60 presents a much better than average value to would-be customers with its combination of standard features, safety, styling, and reasonable pricing.\n\nThe Volvo S60 presents its would-be buyers with a much better than average value. U.S. News and World Report voted the S60 as a finalist for their Best Compact Luxury Car for the Money in 2019.  \n\nAt its starting base price of less than $40,000, an S60 T5 Momentum is affordable compared to other vehicles in its class, while offering more luxury than top-level sedans from brands like Honda or Kia. The S60 also offers a wide variety of standard features, standard safety equipment, and highly-regarded powertrain at each of its price points. Package options on all three main trims allow flexible customer customization for each one's personal needs.  \n\nAttractive styling is another strong selling point of the S60. The exterior and interior are both appealing, simple, and handsome. A comfortable ride and excellent fuel economy back up the S60's looks. Cargo space, average legroom and headroom, and predicted reliability are on par with other competitors with none being stellar.  \n\nThe S60 only falls short when it comes to its interior ergonomics, a finicky infotainment system and sporty handling.  \n\nThe S60 is a great all-around compact luxury sedan that does most things well and very few things poorly.\n\n### More Photos\n\nSee more [2019 Volvo S60 Photos](https://www.autolist.com/volvo-s60-2019/2019-volvo-s60-photos).",

      "body": "The Costco Auto Program is a popular way to buy cars in the U.S. (and Puerto Rico), with Costco members making over 520,000 vehicle purchases through the program in 2017.\n\nBut is the program worth it? Before signing up for a Costco membership to snag a better deal on a new car, it's a good idea to learn how the Costco Auto Program works so you can weigh the pros and cons of using it.\n\n### How Costco's Auto Program Works\n\nThe Costco Auto Program connects Costco members to participating dealerships that offer reduced prices on new vehicles. To use it, members call a Costco service center or plug their preferred vehicle into the CostcoAuto.com directory— including details such as the make, model and model year — and select the car. Costco then finds a local dealer that offers the car at a reduced price and sends the customer the dealer's contact information. \n\nAlthough a Costco call center can help you arrange a purchase directly, the online directory lets you compare reviews and figure out monthly payments as well, so it may provide a more thorough buying experience overall.\n\nCostco doesn't receive a cut of the sales. Instead, dealers each pay Costco a monthly fee to participate in the program and enjoy the large customer base that Costco can direct their way. Because of this arrangement, Costco isn't loyal to any particular dealer, ensuring there's no conflict of interest over its price listings. \n\nCostco trains employees at each participating dealership to interact with referred customers. Certified as Authorized Dealer Contacts, these employees are expected to commit to Costco's price agreement and make customers feel relaxed. They're also tested randomly by Costco employees disguised as shoppers. Dealerships that fail to represent Costco adequately can be booted from the program.\n\n### The Benefits of the Costco Auto Buying Program\n\nMany people find this program helpful, as the Costco price is fixed and no-haggle, meaning you don't have to negotiate with dealers on the spot. Consumers also like the quality of dealers that participate in the Costco program; they usually provide a higher level of service in order to maintain their reputation and participation in the program. \n\nIn addition, the listings in the directory show the invoice price for each car — that is, the price the dealer paid the manufacturer for the vehicle — and the manufacturer's suggested retail price, or MSRP, which reflects how much the manufacturer thinks the dealer should price the car. This openness about each vehicle's value makes the program especially appealing to jaded car buyers. \n\nAs of 2019, the MSRP for vehicles in this program have ranged from less than $20,000 to over $150,000. If you want, you can agree to let Costco check your purchase agreement to make sure you received the agreed-upon price for your purchase. \n\nOn top of the overall vehicle discount, buyers through this program often get discounts on accessories and services relating to the car, such as oil changes.\n\nAnother benefit of the program is its range of options. While the Costco Auto Program offers access to thousands of standard cars, sedans, trucks and SUVs from numerous makes, such as Ford and Honda, you can also buy powersports products — such as RVs, ATVs, UTVs and jet skis — and mobility vehicles. \n\nMembers can also buy used cars that have undergone thorough inspections and repairs. \n\nIf the price for a vehicle is a little steep, even after the discount, you can lease your preferred vehicle instead of purchasing it. To sweeten the deal, the reduced Costco pricing includes factory add-ons, and Costco members are eligible for manufacturer rebates as well. Costco lists all the special financing offers available at dealerships, helping you pick the best individual transaction for you. Finally, you can personalize the vehicle's trim and color as you like.\n\n### The Drawbacks of the Costco Car Buying Program\n\nOne of the biggest drawbacks to this program is that you must be a paying member of Costco to use it. As of 2019, a Costco Gold Star membership costs $60, while a Gold Star Executive membership costs $120. Also, you can't find out how large your discount is unless you visit the dealership, which has a Costco Member-Only price sheet for each vehicle. \n\nAlthough the average discount through the Costco Auto Program is $1,000, this number can vary quite a bit, so you may end up visiting a dealer only to get a disappointing offer. \n\nThere's no guarantee the dealer is going to have your car on hand when you arrive. If this happens, you can ask the dealer to order the car from the manufacturer or another dealership, but you may have to wait a while before it shows up on the lot. Keep in mind, too, that you can use the discount price the dealer offers to haggle with other dealers.\n\nAnother drawback to the program is that, while its prices are solid, it rarely offers the best price you can find. After all, Costco can't control the price that dealerships list for each car before applying the discount, so dealers can easily adjust the original price to make the discounts less damaging to their profits. Plus, nothing beats good old-fashioned negotiation. If you research dealers and vehicles in depth, shopping around and comparing prices until you find the perfect deal, you can potentially save hundreds or even thousands more dollars than Costco Auto can offer. Remember: If you find group-buying discounts promising, you don't have to join this one program. Many banks have group auto-buying programs, and both the United States Automobile Association and the Affinity Auto Program have helped millions of people get cars at a discount. \n\n### Other Considerations\n\nAccording to Costco, about 43 percent of dealership visits through the Costco Auto Program result in a purchase. Some customers trade in their old vehicles for a credit toward their new one, making the final price even lower. Costco also monitors their discount services carefully to ensure they're competitive, so you're likely to drive off the lot happy. \n\nAll in all, the program has a lot going for it. If you're not sold, however, you should take a look at some of the research tools on CostcoAuto.com to learn more about your options. These tools include a vehicle comparison module, which lets you compare the features of two or three vehicles side-by-side, and an expert assessment of your preferred vehicle's performance record. For any vehicle, you can also access a safety evaluation for it, a list of manufacturer incentives and rebates, a finance calculator to calculate your monthly payments and a comparison of whether you should lease or buy the vehicle. Costco even provides a Member Advocacy Group to answer members' questions and help them get the best deals, and they periodically offer coupons and limited-time sales events to boost members' savings as well.\n\nWhether you should join the Costco Auto Program depends on whether you feel becoming a Costco member is worth it, how much you dislike haggling and whether you think Costco's discounts are good enough to justify skipping the research that could net you a better deal. \n\n### Our Take\n\nBuying a new car is expensive and paying $60 for a Costco membership is small amount in comparison to the price of a new car. Even if you don't buy the car, you'll be getting a very competitive quote from a dealer that will help inform your future negotiations. If you're still not sure whether to use the program, try reading some reviews of it, and talk to a representative of the Member Advocacy Group. ",

      "body": "When you go to sell your used car through a private transaction, you'll need to be prepared with some paperwork. Selling privately is the best way to get maximum value for your vehicle vs. trading in at a dealership, but it does mean a little extra homework on your part. Before you list your car for sale, make sure to gather some vital paperwork as indicated below. Not all of these pieces of paperwork are technically legally required, but they can make your car sale go much more smoothly.\n\n### Vehicle History Report\n\nThese days, hardly anyone buys a used car without seeing some vehicle history report. When you place your car ad, you will probably add your VIN to allow prospective buyers to look up your vehicle's history. If you're the first owner of your vehicle, that may be all you need. However, if you're not, you may want to take a look at the vehicle history report yourself to prepare for questions that buyers might have.\n\n### Maintenance Records\n\nIt's easy to say in your ad that your car has been well-maintained, but it's even better to have actual proof of this. Whether you did your own maintenance or had it done at a dealership or repair shop, any kind of records are valuable to prospective buyers. If you performed your vehicle's maintenance yourself, then records of the parts you bought can suffice. \n\n### Warranty Documents\n\nIf you happen to have a remaining warranty on your car that is transferable, then you'll want to have this on hand as well. Having this available can also justify a higher price on your vehicle. However, it's essential to have proof of this warranty ready for the potential buyer to see. It's also a good idea to have some contact information so that the buyer can quickly contact the provider and get the warranty in their name.\n\n### As-Is Document\n\nSo you can protect yourself and make things clear to prospective buyers, have something in writing indicating that your car will be sold as-is. That means that you're not offering any warranties or buyback on the vehicle. By signing it, the buyer agrees that they are accepting all responsibility for the vehicle's condition and future repairs. After you receive payment, and the vehicle changes hands, then the matter is legally done.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Odometer Reading\n\nIf your vehicle is less than 10 years old and weighs 12,000 pounds or less, then the Truth in Mileage Act applies to you. This federal law requires anyone selling a vehicle to disclose the odometer reading to the buyer at the time of sale. The execution of this law may vary by state. Some states allow you to write the current mileage on the title, while others require you to get a separate form. \n\n__An odometer disclosure form typically requires the following:__\n\n- The vehicle's VIN, year, make and model\n\n- Buyer's name, address and signature\n\n- Seller's signature\n\n- Current mileage\n\n- Notary public seal or signature\n\n### Vehicle Title\n\nIf your used car is owned free and clear, then you probably have the vehicle title on hand. You can fill out the space on it for transferring ownership and hand it over to the buyer. However, if your vehicle has a lien, then the title is likely in possession of a bank. To facilitate a sale in this situation, you'll have to call the bank to get a current payoff. You'll then have to work it out with the buyer to make the payoff to the bank and then wait for the title to be sent over.\n\n### Bill of Sale\n\nA bill of sale isn't generally an absolute requirement, but it's a good idea to have for the release of liability. This document lists the comprehensive terms of the sale. You can add the vehicle description, the odometer reading, the price, delivery date, statement of as-is condition, and the signatures of the buyer and seller. You can also get it notarized if you wish. If there's any dispute after the sale, the signed-around bill of sale can protect you from any liability.\n\n### Selling Your Car\n\nOnce you're prepared with the paperwork to sell your car, then you're ready to move onto the logistics. Some things to consider include how to get payment, being prepared for any complications, and making sure to limit your liability. You should also make a checklist of what you need to do to complete the sale. \n\n__Such a list might look like this:__\n\n- Perform a smog test if required by your state\n\n- Prepare a liability-release form and turn it in at the DMV\n\n- Gather any maintenance or parts records to show the buyer\n\n- Remove the license plates from the car if your state requires it\n\n- Remove all personal items, including registration from your glove compartment and any other areas in your car\n\n- Gather all keys and any papers to transfer to the new owner\n\n- Cancel your insurance on the car\n\n### Receiving Payment\n\nOne of the most critical parts of the car sale is getting payment for your car. The easiest way to deal with this is only to accept cash. If the buyer requests a receipt, you can provide the bill of sale. However, if your car is commanding a price well over $2,000, then it might be a better idea to deal with a cashier's check. The easiest way to conduct this transaction is for both buyer and seller to go to the seller's bank and complete the transfer. That way, it's in a safe place, and the buyer can be assured that everything is legit. In the case of a remote sale, then an escrow service can be used to verify funds between buyer and seller.\n\n### Limit Your Liability\n\nHave you ever wondered what happens if someone buys your car and then gets into an accident? That is why you need to cover your bases as much as possible. A bill of sale and signed-over title in the hands of your buyer will help. You can also immediately get onto the DMV site and report the vehicle as sold. It's a good idea to cancel your insurance as soon as possible too.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### What About Complications?\n\nIn another complicated scenario, what if the buyer contacts you the next day and wants to return the car? What if they claim that you didn't reveal a significant mechanical problem that suddenly turned up? The good thing is that most states consider an as-is sale as the default. That means there are no guarantees of anything after the sale. It also means that it's up to the buyer to do their due diligence in inspecting the vehicle. As the seller, you may want to encourage them to check it out as well thoroughly. It is another area where the bill of sale comes into play. If the buyer signed off on accepting the car as is, there is no recourse from their end.\n\n### Setting a Fair Asking Price\n\nWhen you start deciding on a price, remember that you will likely have to field lower offers unless your car is very much in demand. With this in mind, you may want to set the price just above market value. Start by looking up your vehicle's value on Kelley Blue Book and Edmunds. Then you may want to check sites like Craigslist to see what cars are selling for in your local area. Another thing to consider is where to round off. Many people search using the nearest $1,000. For example, if you list your car at $6,200 and it's worth under $6,000, you likely won't get those buyers capping their searches at $6,000. You might consider listing your car at $5,900 instead.\n\n### Curb Appeal\n\nIt's not just for selling houses. You don't have to spend a fortune to fix everything on your car, but you should at least give it a thorough wash and vacuum. You want car buyers to show up and immediately like the looks of the vehicle as it sits. That is especially important if you have had pets in your car. \n\n### Take Good Photos\n\nThe very first impression a buyer is likely to have is from your advertisement. Writing a good ad is essential, but even more important are quality pictures. Take pictures of your vehicle in good lighting and from several different angles. Photograph the of the inside, including the front and back seats if applicable, and with the doors open. Take a full shot of the vehicle from the side, as well as from the front and back. You may also want to consider an engine shot and pictures of the tires to show tread wear. It's also a good idea to take a picture of the odometer to verify the mileage you are stating. A view of the underside isn't a bad idea either.\n\n### Where to List Your Car\n\nThere are many places to list your car online. Craigslist is very popular and available for the nominal fee of $5, but scams are still prevalent. More specialized sites include Autotrader, eBay Motors and Car Gurus. If you're selling a rare or specialty vehicle, then you might consider various collector sites. Write your ad with any details that might add value, such as options or recent upgrades.\n\n### Screen Buyers\n\nSave time and hassle by reviewing all offers carefully before getting back to the buyer. You should generally avoid the ones that sound generic or like they're contacting several listings at once. Lowball offers are likely not legit either.\n\n### Set Up the Meeting\n\nOnce you have a reasonable offer, set up a meeting place in a safe area, and have someone else with you. Ride along on the test drive, but resist the temptation to sell them the car. Just answer any questions they might have or point out anything they don't know about the vehicle. If everything checks out, then you can arrange payment and transfer ownership with the documents you've prepared.",

      "body": " \nAutolist rating: __3/5__\nBut would we buy it? __Probably__\nPrice range: __$73,995 - $97,265 __, including destination\n \n---\n \n## Key takeaways:\n-   760-horsepower supercharged V8 and seven-speed dual-clutch transmission make this model one to remember.\n- Most powerful Mustang – or Ford of any kind – that the automaker has sold as a production car.\n- Combines terrifying power numbers with supreme approachability.\n- Could serve as both a daily driver around town and a full-bore track weapon on the weekends.\n- Starts at $74,000 (reasonable) and climbs to nearly $100,000 (far less reasonable).\n\n![2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-14](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1lhdw9lWSRo02doRFUsDVN/bc66d8521d48eebee00d97ed9287f439/2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-14.jpg) \n\n---\n \n## What is it?\nThe Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 (quite a mouthful) is the most powerful Mustang Ford has ever offered (and indeed it’s the most powerful production car the venerable automaker has ever made). Pushing out 760 horsepower courtesy of a supercharged 5.2-liter V8, this uber-Mustang sits atop of prolific range of Ford’s iconic muscle car lineup; other models include the Shelby GT350 and GT350R, Bullitt, GT, and a pair of EcoBoost turbocharged four-cylinder models.\n \nThe GT500 pays homage to the original GT500 that was launched in 1967 and built for several years; there was also a GT500 iteration of the previous generation Mustang as well.\n\n![2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7AWeuuBRz2G57Orbd8twxK/a36baaf1d3c2b0be177e7dd236cbaa10/2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-3.jpg) \n\n \nThis new model comes with a single powertrain: the aforementioned 5.2-liter, V8 engine, and its supercharger (hand-built no less) that makes 760 horsepower and 625 pound-feet of torque. This immense power is routed to the rear wheels via a new Tremec seven-speed dual-clutch automated transmission with paddle shifters – the first such transmission put in the Mustang in the marque’s history.\n \nFord says this GT500 will do 0-60 in a scant 3.3 seconds, the quarter-mile in 10.7 seconds, and has a 180-MPH top speed. Despite these impressive stats, this is also the heaviest Mustang Ford sells, weighing in at 4,171 pounds for the base GT500 without the optional Carbon Fiber Track pack; for reference, the GT350 with the Track Pack weighs 3,790 pounds and your average GT with the V8 engine and an automatic transmission weighs 3,733 pounds.\n \nThe GT500 starts at $73,995, and the Carbon Fiber Track pack adds another $18,500 to the price. This set of upgrades includes the 20-inch carbon fiber wheels that are wrapped in Michelin Pilot Cup Sport tires, carbon fiber instrument panel, a larger carbon fiber rear wing, Recaro leather seats, and it deletes that pesky rear seat that’s always hogging weight.\n\n![2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-12](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7bSLeDWO8DzthOTBUer4Dj/a972394daf339253632684ec36bff85e/2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-12.jpg)\n \nCompared to your ‘standard’ Mustang, the GT500 upgrades nearly every system that matters when it comes to going faster. The suspension geometry has been tweaked, there’s a new power steering unit, and new lighter-weight coil springs on the front and rear suspension with MagneRide adaptive dampers.\n \nThe brakes are now Brembo six-piston calipers, and there are numerous body modifications aimed at more street presence, great downforce, and better cooling.\n \nInside, trim pieces have been upgrades to exposed carbon fiber, microsuede fabric on the door panels and optional Recaro seats, a 12-inch digital instrument panel, and an eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system with optional B&O stereo system.\n \n---\n \n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n \n \n## What’s good\n \n*TLDR: Loves curves as much as it does straights, looks great doing either*\n \n__Powertrain:__ If Ford says this model is the most powerful road car it’s ever sold, you know the powertrain is going to be a good one. This supercharged V8 and dual-clutch setup are a sublime pairing. The engine has all of the sound, feedback, and power you would expect given the Shelby GT500 badge, without being tedious or overly raw. The transmission is also a sweetheart (for the most part – see ‘Minor Hiccups’ below), ripping off ultra-quick shifts that are perfectly timed in automatic mode and perfectly quick in manual mode. While this GT500’s horsepower rating certainly makes your eyes water, it’s approachable, useful power rather than the kind that will bite your head off if you look at it weird.\n \n ![2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-13](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/qYmKID1cV2lEblgekfZ7M/21b532f0059fa45c1dcd03a4a0074ccb/2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-13.jpg)\n \n \n__It can turn:__ Sure, 760 horses will quickly get you moving in a straight line, but that doesn’t mean the car will handle curves (looking at you Challenger Hellcat). Ford knew this would be a concern going into the development of the GT500 and took pains to address it. The result is a car that will go a long way towards shaking the notion that muscle cars can’t turn. This is thanks to smart suspension tuning (plus the standard damping system is the excellent MagneRide continuously adjustable setup), plenty of aero generating downforce and gobs of tire connecting the car to the ground (base tires are the Michelin Pilot Sport 4S while the Carbon Fiber Track Pack comes with ultra-sticky Michelin Pilot Sport Cups). It creates a Mustang that bearhugs the street or the track, allowing you to put down surprising amounts of power coming out of turns without worrying that you’ll end up facing the wrong way (or upside down).\n \n \n __Looks the part:__ What’s the point of owning a car so capable if it doesn’t also look the business? While earlier generations of Shelby models looked a little gaudy in retrospect, this GT500 just looks mean – the good kind of mean. Exterior modifications are smartly executed to give this Mustang plenty of functional presence without looking like a goofy wannabe street racer or midlife crisis cliché.\n \n ![2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4tLNN2d7c5kaMqu1SJpY5G/0391e56144f329ff6d1e3fe684972c2d/2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-2.jpg) \n \n---\n \n## What’s bad\n*TLDR: Gets pricey with Track Pack, interior pieces subpar, slight tuning tweaks still needed.*\n \n__Expensive:__ Yes, you read that right. This Mustang -- when loaded up with the options we tested -- can get within sneezing distance of the $100,000. That’s a ton of money (though this is a ton of car). Despite all you get for your considerable money, we’d push buyers towards the base GT500 without the $18,500 Carbon Fiber Track Pack. While its additions are cool, they’re ultimately not what makes the GT500 truly great; that stuff is already baked into the base model (if you can call it that). Still, the GT500’s price tag – no matter the options – is put into perspective by the new midengined Corvette C8. Sure, base models of the C8 are down about 260 horsepower to the GT500, but the Chevy does start thousands of dollars cheaper.\n \n__Basic interior:__ The problem with most high-performance iterations of vehicles that start at much lower price points is the fast ones usually share much of the interior bits of the cheap ones. That’s the case here with this GT500, which has an interior full of reminders that there’s a $27,000 Mustang out there too. Yes, there are some significant upgrades like stellar Recaro racing seats and an all-digital instrument panel, but that still leaves plenty of pieces inside the GT500 that feel conspicuously subpar considering its asking price.\n\n![2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-4](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/25feRWPjAqJyNY50CqIE8T/a21a5acc9ecebc9d6d06bf30ca9e9097/2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-4.jpg) \n \n__Minor hiccups:__ For all the well-executed elements of the GT500, there were still a few minor glitches in the overall performance. In street driving, when you eased off the throttle, the dual-clutch transmission would occasionally upshift (with a shudder) too early. There seems to be a scootch more programming needed to tell the gearbox what to do in these conditions. Also, the brake pedal tended to feel a little too spongy for our taste; we were left wanting a dash more firmness and feedback when really getting on them hard (though the massive Brembo brakes themselves were stellar and fade-free in repeated track laps).\n \n \n---\n \n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n \n \n## 5 stars of execution\n \nSafety Features? __NO__\n- Likely owing to it being a driving-focused car, this Mustang isn’t offered with the same type of standard safety tech as lesser Mustangs.\n- This includes adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, pre-collision alerts and automatic emergency braking, or rain-sensing wipers; blind-spot monitoring is only offered as part of the $3,000 tech pack.\n\n ![2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-15](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5cChbSeTDKmrDM65xp8hL2/ce5d5b75d8b65c1e3490127e5c566708/2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-15.jpg)\n \nValue? __YES__\n- The base version’s $74,000 sticker – sans $18,500 Carbon track pack – is a much more reasonable asking price considering Chevy’s fire-breathing Corvette Z06 starts at about $80,000.\n- Plus, this GT500 is arguably the most capable-yet-approachable Mustang that Ford has ever built.\n- But at a tick under $100,000, it’s hard to justify the price of a loaded Mustang Shelby GT500, no matter the performance envelope.\n \n \nEfficiency? __NO__\n- No one buys these cars to sip fuel. Quite the opposite. But for those who are interested, the EPA rates this Mustang at 12/18/14 MPG city/highway/combined.\n- While that’s not the worst we’ve seen, real-world driving during our testing (not even on the track!) drained the tank exceptionally quickly; we’d expect less than 200 miles per tank under the normal-to-hard driving these owners will be doing.\n \n![2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-11](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/41oymfFKc1HeNQLSGoDBY5/a1ba74e1d46c3bb0f14b60ae75a16882/2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-11.jpg) \n \nDriving experience? __YES__\n-   The driving experience is the whole point of a car like this. And it succeeds in a very big way.\n-   The handling on the street and the racetrack is exceptional. It’s poised, confident, and predictable on the track and refined, comfortable, and engaging on the street. It’s a win-win.\n \n \nExecution? __YES__\n- Ford hit the mark with this GT500. It’s the perfect complement to the GT350 in its Mustang lineup and a model that the brand should have no trouble selling out of.\n- It’s impeccably comfortable, approachable, and well-mannered in daily driving, and it could easily serve as your sole mode of transportation.\n- Yet the very same car without any modifications is also a beast on the track – especially in capable hands who know how to trust its considerable grip – and will devour plenty of lesser cars on track day.\n \n## Total Rating: 3 stars\n\n![2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2IuSsXIgR9OX5dQ7I9alIB/9b57c29a337905d55cf70a3bd5a0020c/2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-1.jpg) \n \n---\n \n## What’s it gonna cost me?\nThe base (if you can call it that) Mustang Shelby GT500 starts at $74,000. That starting price gets you the sublime powertrain (supercharged V8 and dual-clutch transmission), 20-inch alloy wheels, leather and suede seats, limited-slip differential, dual exhaust with multiple sound modes, Brembo brakes, rear spoiler, hood vents, Ford’s Sync infotainment system, power driver and passenger seat, and a 12-inch digital instrument panel.\n \nFrom there, buyers can choose one of two handling packages and a Technology package.\n \nThe lesser of the two handling packages is the $1,500 Handling Pack, which adds a Gurney flap on the rear spoiler for added downforce, and splitter wickers on the car’s front splitter.\n\n![2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-9](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/CWtOGacEZVRXCoEa0cmAZ/00f31cf61f42cc61a41feb5258e906ed/2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-9.jpg)\n \nThe $18,500 Carbon Fiber Track Pack (which cannot be combined with the Handling Pack) adds 20-inch carbon fiber wheels that are wrapped in Michelin Pilot Cup Sport tires, a carbon-fiber instrument panel, larger carbon fiber rear wing, and Recaro leather seats.\n \nBuyers can also add the $3,000 Tech package, which adds a B&O sound system with 12 speakers and an in-trunk subwoofer, blind-spot monitoring with cross-traffic alerts, heated side-view mirrors with puddle lamps, a touchscreen navigation system, and memory settings for the power seats.\n\n![2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-8](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/bJZXTysLlzF6ITexU5BmB/acea173a1b59c12a6b5e0d2503d10dd4/2020-ford-mustang-gt500-image-8.jpg)\n \n \n---\n \n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n \n ## Also consider\n \nThere’s not a lot of true head-to-head competition at this price and power range.\n \nChevy’s outgoing C7 Corvette Z06 is probably its closest competitor; it’s front-engined, massively powerful, and offers heaps of grip on the street and the track. Choosing between the two is a no-lose proposition since they’re both stellar but gun to our head, we’d probably opt for the Shelby GT500 simply because it’s fresh.\n \nThere’s also Chevy’s Camaro ZL1, but with less power and almost $10,000 less asking price, it’s a lesser car; comparing them feels unfair. If you’re a Chevy fan and or you’re keen to save the money, then, by all means, do so.\n \nDodge’s Challenger Hellcat also comes to mind, but it absolutely couldn’t keep up on the track and provided nowhere near the same levels of feedback and control.\n \nFord recently made some significant improvements to the 2020 GT350R, so how do these two models stack up? One engineer at the GT500 press launch likened the two models to the Porsche GT3 and GT2. The GT3 – like Ford’s GT350R – the purist’s car thanks to its naturally-aspirated engine and manual transmission. Yes, it’s down on raw power relative to its sibling, but it is aimed at the buyer who is willing to give up some sheer grunt and get more control and feedback in return.\n \nThe GT500 – like Porsche’s GT2 – is a numbers car, aiming to put the most power down to the road and track by any means necessary. This means forced induction and an automated manual transmission, a tradeoff for the more honest approach taken by the car’s sibling.\n",

      "body": "Scammers posing as legitimate warranty companies like to call car owners with offers to renew their car warranties, only to swindle them out of money with poor vehicle service contracts. Here's how you can detect vehicle warranty scams to avoid getting stung by them.\n\n### How Do Car Warranty Scams Work?\n\nMost car warranty scams are straightforward. A scammer masquerading as a legitimate company, such as a car dealer or insurer, calls you to let you know your car warranty is due to expire. The scammer then offers you an extended warranty and asks for your personal information to draw up a vehicle service contract. Many such calls are robocalls—that is, automated calls that churn through many people quickly and that usually feature pre-recorded voices—and are therefore easy to detect. But others involve real people who may know a lot about your vehicle and warranty. They may know your name, the make and model of your vehicle, your vehicle's mileage, and the terms of your insurance or warranty agreements. Most of this information can be purchased online from data collection companies. The service contracts that these scammers offer typically range from $1,000 to $3,000 and tend to include woefully incomplete coverage, such as coverage of part of the engine rather than the whole. Getting a refund from the scammer never works, and scammers like to target seniors. Other car warranty scams include fake warranty expiration slips sent by mail and featuring a toll-free phone number for you to call. These notices typically have the return address of a motor vehicle department or vehicle manufacturer for a touch of credibility, and they may have bold-text warnings that read \"Final Notice\" or \"Priority Level: High.\" \n\nCar warranty scammers often use high-pressure sales tactics to push owners to buy their service contracts. These promises include saying their offers are one-time-only or that it's easy to cancel if you change your mind. The scammer may even threaten to delete your warranty or insurance files if you don't sign up for the contract. If pressed to provide a copy of the terms and conditions of the agreement, the scammer may request a down payment before sending it. Although some scammers practice straight fraud, others rely on legal loopholes to get away with unfair practices, such as by including carefully worded fine print in their contracts. Some scammers don't explicitly state that their offers are warranties and instead claim they're just offering \"repairs.\" Alternatively, some scammers duplicate the coverage of consumers' actual warranties. Scammers may ask for your bank account information, Social Security number, driver's license number or credit card information over the phone. They may then sell this information to fraudsters or use it to steal your money. Car warranty scammers may also send you emails with addresses that look to belong to real dealerships. Although caller ID can give scammers away, such as by displaying a 1-800 number, the more advanced car warranty scam calls have legitimate-looking numbers. The scammers may even use the telemarketing trick of calling you from a number that appears to be local. To seem authentic, callers may \"transfer\" you to other scammers and then ask for details about your vehicle, such as whether you get it serviced often or whether your check engine light is on.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### How to Protect Yourself from Auto Warranty Scams\n\nProtecting yourself from these scams is easy once you know how they work. Use caller ID to screen phone calls because comanpanies are required by law to display a genuine number to contact to request that they stop calling. Similarly, cell phone providers sometimes offer apps to help you screen telemarketers, and you can also find such apps online. Unless you have proof that the company calling you is authentic, never give them sensitive information, such as your credit card or bank account details. If you receive a verbal or written correspondence regarding your car's warranty, check the manufacturer's contact information online to see if it matches. A service contract isn't always the best idea because you might be able to save more money by putting aside a repair and maintenance fund once you buy a vehicle. As a rule, don't agree to any contract without reading the terms and conditions, including the fine print, and comparing these against the Federal Trade Commission's Auto Service Contracts and Warranties guide.\n\nIf you want extra protection against scam calls, consider investing in robocall-blocking software such as YouMail. If YouMail's database detects a scam caller, it plays an \"out of service\" message to trick scammers into deleting your number from their call lists. You can also check YouMail's database for adverse reports. Keep in mind that not all third-party warranty companies are unscrupulous, even when they lack ties to manufacturers. And you always should file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission if scammers harass you. The FCC can fine companies that violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Occasionally, the FCC returns the money conned from consumers right back to them. In 2011, the FCC gave $3.2 million in refunds to 4,450 people who bought fake warranty coverage. In 2019, they awarded $4 million to about 6,000 people for the same reason. Making a consumer complaint to the Better Business Bureau is another good way to pressure scammers to give you a refund. Also, the BBB has records of previous complaints, which you can check for help in detecting scams. For extra peace of mind, log your phone number on the FTC's National Do Not Call Register.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Other Considerations\n\nScammers tend to follow a similar playbook when they call. Their knowledge of cars tends to be superficial, so it's easy to catch them, making blatant mistakes about your vehicle or your personal information. When rattling off a list of parts that their warranties supposedly cover, they may mention parts unrelated to your vehicle. Scammers also tend to backtrack when pressed on specifics about their company, such as the location of their offices. Also, they tend to speak fast and offer a significant discount during the hard-sell process, and they frequently sell their coverage as a monthly payment plan. They may also claim that their warranty has no sales tax, which is most likely false. When shopping for car insurance online, keep in mind that any data you input, such as your car's make and model, can fall into the hands of scammers. Don't be afraid to hang up on telemarketers. Real manufacturers don't call consumers day after day or use high-pressure sales techniques. When in doubt, check your manufacturer's warranty for an expiration date or search Google for their warranty extension policies. In contrast to third-party warranty companies, auto manufacturers tend to offer robust extended warranties with thorough coverage. Finally, if you've already been scammed and want restitution, you can always call your state Attorney General and ask to sue the scammer.\n\nCar warranty scams are a growing problem now that people's contact information and other details are easy to get online.  However, it's still essential to keep up with scam trends. Be wary about companies that you might not be able to find quickly with an internet search or aren't from your automaker or local dealer. If you know how scammers operate, however, you can avoid falling for their tricks every time.",

      "body": "Gas mileage wasn't always a concern for automobile drivers as the first automobiles were much less efficient than they are now. Following the Clean Air Act, the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency and oil crises of the 1970s and 1980s, it became a concern as people became more aware of fuel conservation and the environmental impact of vehicle emissions. \n\n### Miles Per Gallon or GPM?\n\nThe standard way to measure fuel economy is through MPG, which is how many miles a car can go on one gallon of gas. MPG ratings are typically higher on the freeway versus the city. City driving requires a lot of slow speeds with higher RPM, plus a lot of idling, which drains gas without much movement. Therefore, most vehicles get at least five MPG more on the highway versus the city. \n\nThe GPM rating is something conceived by Edmunds to figure out how many gallons the vehicle needs to drive 100 miles. For example, if a vehicle is rated at 12.5 GPM, it needs eight gallons of fuel to go 100 miles. Some consider this a better method of determining a fuel-efficient vehicle than miles per gallon.\n\n### Does Octane Affect MPG?\n\nWith the introduction of catalytic converters in U.S. vehicles in the 1970s, vehicles started to run almost exclusively on unleaded gas instead of leaded. That allowed engines to have a cleaner operation, which had the additional effect of increasing gas mileage. The octane rating of unleaded gasoline can also affect it. When you go to the gas station, you might see that there are numbers on each pump. The lowest is usually 87 octane. The higher the octane rating, the slower the gas burns, which makes the vehicle run more efficiently. However, most vehicles only require 87 octane gas, and the higher octane gas has a negligible effect on MPG in most cases. On the other hand, vehicles that require or recommend higher octane gas may see a significant loss of MPG by using 87 octane instead of the higher numbers. Higher octane gas costs more, but it may translate into savings with better gas mileage.\n\n### Cars Versus Trucks\n\nIt's no secret that passenger cars tend to get better fuel economy than trucks and SUVs. What is the reason for this? The main reason is that cars are built on a unibody chassis and trucks are typically made with a body mounted on the frame. That's part of the reason why modern, car-based SUVs tend to get much better gas mileage than earlier, truck-based models. Small SUVs like the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V were among the first to be built on a passenger car chassis and saw increased fuel efficiency. With the emergence of crossover SUVs in the present day, more and more SUVs are being built on car chassis and are typically much more fuel-efficient than the few remaining body-on-frame SUVs.\n\n### Hybrid Fuel Efficiency\n\nThe other type of extremely fuel-efficient vehicle is a hybrid. These vehicles use both a gas engine and an electric engine. The electric motor typically runs the car at idle or slow speeds before the gasoline engine takes over or supplements the motor. As previously mentioned, most vehicles lose significant fuel economy driving at slow speeds in the city. Hybrids can run cleaner and more efficiently in situations where full gas vehicles cannot. Hybrids have become more prevalent in the present day, and there are also plenty of hybrid SUVs and larger cars available now.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Driver Ability Effect On Gas Mileage\n\nThe other factor in good gas mileage is how you drive. Aggressive drivers who drive at higher rates of speed typically see much worse fuel economy to those who drive at a lower rate of speed and without a lot of hard acceleration. For example, accelerating quickly from a full stop burns a lot more gas than getting up to speed slowly and steadily. Similarly, if you constantly tailgate and have to step on the brakes and then speed up again, you're also burning more gas. Driving more steadily tends to yield quite a bit of gas savings.\n\n### Vehicle Condition And Fuel Economy\n\nAnother effect on fuel economy is the condition of the vehicle in question. A well-maintained and newer vehicle is likely to get better gas mileage than one that is in poor condition or has a lot of miles. Changing the oil and oil filter regularly and keeping tires at proper inflation is essential for getting good gas mileage. It's also a good idea to run injector cleaners from time to time to keep those from becoming clogged and reducing fuel economy.\n\n### Fuel Economy By Type\n\nIt's easy enough to say that a vehicle getting 50 MPG on the highway is a very fuel-efficient vehicle. However, not everyone can drive the same type of vehicle. Therefore, it's useful to look at what fuel economy rating is suitable for certain types of vehicles. Not only that, but different people in different situations may have a particular idea of what good fuel economy is to them. Getting 15 MPG driving around town might be entirely acceptable for some people as good fuel economy. For others, this might be low. For example, a 2019 Porsche Boxster gets 25 MPG combined city and highway, while a 2019 Honda Accord LX gets 31 MPG combined. At first glance, you'd likely say that the Accord gets better MPG, which is technically correct. But 24 MPG combined for a sports car is not bad. And most people do not buy sports cars or full-size trucks on their excellent fuel economy.\n\n### Most Fuel-Efficient Passenger Cars Including Electric Cars\n\n__According to the EPA, the following vehicles are the most fuel-efficient passenger cars in each class:__\n\n1. Two-Seaters - Smart EQ Fortwo (coupe) 108 MPG combined\n\n2. Minicompacts - Fiat 500e 112 MPG combined\n\n3. Subcompacts - BMW i3 113 MPG combined\n\n4. Compacts - Volkswagen e-Golf 119 MPG combined\n\n5. Midsize - Hyundai Ioniq Electric 136 MPG combined\n\n6. Large - Tesla Model S Long Range 111 MPG combined\n\n7. Small Station Wagons - Chevrolet Bolt EV 119 MPG combined\n\n8. Midsize Station Wagons - Volvo V90 FWD 27 MPG combined\n\nThe only category without an electric vehicle is that of the midsize station wagon, which is why the MPG goes down drastically. \n\n### Most Fuel-Efficient Passenger Cars Excluding Electric Cars\n\nTo compare, let's look at the fuel efficiency of small passenger cars that are not electric. \n\n__According to the EPA, these are the most fuel-efficient cars by class:__\n\n1. Two-Seaters - Fiat 124 Spider and Mazda MX-5 30 MPG combined\n\n2. Minicompacts - MINI Cooper Convertible 31 MPG combined\n\n3. Subcompacts - Chevrolet Spark 33 MPG combined\n\n4. Compacts - Toyota Prius C Hybrid 46 MPG combined\n\n5. Midsize - Toyota Prius Eco Hybrid 56 MPG combined\n\n6. Large - Hyundai Ioniq Blue Hybrid 58 MPG combined\n\n7. Small Station Wagons - Kia Niro FE Hybrid 50 MPG combined\n\n8. Midsize Station Wagons - Volvo V90 FWD 27 MPG combined\n\nYou might think compact cars would get better MPG, but due to the presence of hybrids in this list, the more substantial cars fare better.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Fuel-Efficient Muscle Cars\n\nMuscle cars typically are more massive and put out more horsepower than something falling in the roadster sports car category. For example, the Mazda MX-5 Miata gets a 30 MPG city/highway combined rating from the EPA but weighs less than some compact hatchbacks. On the other hand, the Mercedes-AMG C63 S offers a 503 horsepower turbocharged V8 engine, and it gets 20 MPG combined. A BMW M4 has 425 horsepower from a turbocharged six-cylinder engine and gets roughly the same combined MPG. The Nissan 370Z gets 22 MPG combined with its 3.7-liter V6 engine and six-speed manual transmission. \n\nSome high-performance cars can use more advanced technology to extract more efficiency out of big engines. Some versions of the Chevrolet Corvette Stingray, for example, achieve up to 29 MPG highway through cylinder deactivation, allowing it to run on only four cylinders in highway cruising situations. However, this technology is typically found on more expensive vehicles.\n\n### Most Fuel-Efficient Trucks, Vans and SUVs\n\nThe other vehicle categories that typically offer lower MPG are trucks, SUVs and minivans or regular vans. Similar to muscle cars, you can't reasonably expect to get much more than 20 MPG overall in a non-hybrid, and few offer more than 30 MPG even on the highway. \n\n__The list of vehicles that are not electric from the EPA seems to bear that out as follows:__\n\n1. Small Pickup Trucks - Chevrolet Colorado 2WD Diesel and GMC Canyon 2WD Diesel 23 MPG combined\n\n2. Standard Pickup Trucks - Ford F150 Pickup 2WD Diesel 25 MPG combined\n\n3. Small Sport Utility Vehicles - Toyota RAV4 Hybrid AWD 40 MPG combined\n\n4. Standard SUVs - Lexus RX 450h AWD Hybrid 30 MPG combined\n\n5. Minivans - Chrysler Pacifica, Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna 2WD 22 MPG combined\n\nThe primary factor bringing the overall MPG of these vehicles down is their city driving efficiency. For example, the Colorado LT Diesel gets a relatively impressive 30 MPG on the highway, but it only manages 20 MPG in city driving. The F-150 also gets only 30 MPG on the highway but achieves a slightly higher 22 MPG city mileage. Further, all of the standouts in the SUV category are hybrids. When you look at a standard SUV like the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk with a V8, it only gets 13 MPG combined.\n\nIn summary, the question of what is good gas mileage depends on a lot of factors, including driving situation, vehicle type and condition, and the driver's ability.",

      "body": "### Summary\n\nThe 2019 Toyota Tundra is an American-made full-size pickup. Originally in production since 1999, this year’s Tundra is part of the third generation of the vehicle released in 2014. \n\nThe Tundra is the first North American full-size pickup truck built by a Japanese automaker to be produced in the United States. Originally produced at the company’s production facility in Princeton, Indiana, since 2008, all Tundras have been built in San Antonio, Texas. \n\nOverall, the 2019 Tundra features a variety of high points such as its standard V8 engine, high ratings for reliability, and reintroduction of the Tundra TRD Pro trim. Many reviewers felt the Tundra was not able to match up against competitors with higher safety ratings, towing capacities and performance. \n\nOriginally debuted in 2015 to compete against the [Ford SVT Raptor](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150-raptor) and [Ram 1500 Rebel](https://www.autolist.com/ram-ram+pickup+1500), the Tundra TRD Pro is designed for rugged off-road all-terrain driving and ultra-high capacity towing. \n\nThe Tundra TRD Pro features Toyota’s Safety Sense P  and Safety Star Systems. These safety features offer stability and traction control, brake- force distribution adjustments, anti-lock brakes, smart-stop technology, pre-collision alerts, lane departure alerts, automatic high beam lights, sway control and adaptive cruise control. \n\nA high performance shock and suspension system featuring 11 bypass zones for front shocks and 12 for rear, in addition to a small remote reservoir help to keep the Tundra TRD cool and able to haul massive loads. \n\nThe Tundra TRD Pro includes 18- inch BBS alloy wheels, a re designed 1/4-inch-thick front skid plate with a renewed TRD logo, LED headlights with black accent details, dual exist system with black tips, and foglights.\n\nInside, the 2019 Tundra TRD Pro has TRD branded floor mats, leather seats with red accent stitching and unique “TRD” logos on head restraints and shift knob. \n\nThis Tundra trim is available in three colors: Super White, Midnight Black Metallic and Voodoo Blue (exclusive to TRD Pro). This year’s Tundra TRD Pro is also available with an optional moonroof. \n\n### Exterior\n\nThe Toyota Tundra has 18-inch alloy wheels which are perfect for off-road driving. The Tundra exterior also has an aluminum skid plate. This feature adds protection as well as an additional style point.\n\n![2019-toyota-tundra-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1UFytRMZ2p02HOzcHtC8eC/184917415e2913e6525789f51d8a9b09/2019-toyota-tundra-exterior1.jpg)\n\nThe Tundra has tuned dual exhaust system with black chrome exhaust tips. \n\nThe Toyota Tundra is available in: \n\n- Cavalry Blue\n- Voodoo Blue*\n- Midnight Black Metallic\n- Smoked Mesquite\n- Magnetic Gray Metallic\n- Quicksand\n- Cement\n- Silver Sky Metallic\n- Super White\n- Barcelona Red Metallic \n\n*Only available in the Toyota TRP Pro \n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nThe 2019 Tundra offers a decent amount of comfort for use as a daily driver work vehicle or recreationally focused off-roader. \n\nWhile older versions of this truck were frequently applauded for their largest in class interior space, many reviewers cite redesigned rivals as currently offering massive amounts of space. \n\nThat said, the Tundra is comfortable for 5-6 passengers spread across its front and rear seats. \n\nSome trim levels allow the option to change standard front row bench seats for more comfortable bucket seats. Cloth upholstery, four-way adjustable front seats, and a folding rear-seat bench with a 60/40 split are standard options in this truck.  \n\nSome reviewers found the Tundra’s interior to lack design elements found in similar trucks including Toyota’s own compact truck, the [Tacoma](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-tacoma). They also cited the lack of keyless entry as a possible drawback for some buyers. \n\n![2019-toyota-tundra-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6tYpinfYAFexnAhGabutlU/d5228c590fdaa2857e43b1be05892963/2019-toyota-tundra-interior1.jpg)\n\nLeather upholstery, power-adjustable front seats, a leather-trimmed, adjustable steering wheel, and heated seats with ventilation are available as upgrades. The CrewMax cab offers an additional rear-seat legroom by 7.6 inches and adds full-size rear doors.\n\nTundra CrewMax models have a higher rating of “Acceptable” for rear LATCH car-seat connectors than Double Cabs. The two sets of lower anchors for the LATCH system are very easy to locate. The third LATCH connector is located  behind the driver's seat in a position some reviewers described as being placed too deep in the seat cushions.\n\n![2019-toyota-tundra-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3Su4fSX9giUEb127RzYVGr/834cc09c40d08f84f46d042ea111c3f7/2019-toyota-tundra-interior2.jpg)\n\n### Utility & Practicality\n\nThe 2019 Toyota Tundra, depending on trim level and drivetrain configuration, can tow between 6,400 to 10,200 pounds of cargo. This allows the Tundra to compete against trucks like the [Nissan Frontier](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-frontier), [Ford F-150](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150), [GMC Sierra 1500](https://www.autolist.com/gmc-sierra+1500), and Chevrolet Silverado. \n\nThe 2019 Toyota Tundra comes with a three-year/36,000-mile basic warranty and a five-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty. The new car program also offers two years of roadside assistance with an unlimited distance covered. \n\nWith a maximum payload ranging from 1,490 to 1,730 pounds, the Tundra is well suited for many applications. Whether towing a boat or hauling equipment to a job site, the Tundra offers a great deal of utility and practicality. \n\nThe Toyota Tundra has a  Tow Package with added engine and transmission oil coolers. The Tundra has double overhead cams and a dual independent variable valve timing to support heavy duty towing requirements. \n\nThe Tunda with optional 5.7 liter V8 engine also have a Tow/Haul mode which automatically adjusts pulling power, throttle response and braking to ensure safe maneuvering even with excessive loads. \n\nThis truck also has integrated brake and trailer sway controls to make it easier to park the truck while towing a heavy payload. This also improves emergency braking stability\n\nThe 2019 Toyota Tundra includes a variety of features which offer tons of utility and practicality in work, everyday or recreational situations. \n\n![2019-toyota-tundra-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4hbq7MElHrPecnyIdJkyCf/b9eb784982b403f31a7bf97d91c64895/2019-toyota-tundra-exterior2.jpg)\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Technology & Infotainment\n\nThis year’s Toyota Tundra earned high marks from many reviewers for the standard technology and infotainment components included in base trim levels. Every Tundra features an Entune infotainment system, touch-screen display, voice command system and a well-rounded suite of safety features. \n\nMany reviewers have rated the Entune infotainment platform found in Toyotas to be a well-designed and intuitive system that is easy for nearly all passengers to operate. \n\nUnlike some other cars in Toyota’s 2019 lineup, the Tundra does not support Apple CarPlay  though the upgraded infotainment system available in some trim levels, does allow for smartphone integration with the Entune suite of apps for phones and tablets. \n\nSome reviewers found even the upgraded 7 inch Entune infotainment touch screen to appear small when compared to other systems available on the market today. \n\n### Safety & Driving Assistance\n\nThe 2019 Tundra received a “Good” rating for its side, moderate overlap front, head restraint and seats from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). The Double Cab trims also received a “Good” rating for it’s roof strength and all trims received a “Superior” score in front crash prevention. \n\nCrewMax Tundras received an “Acceptable” score from the IIHS for it’s roof strength. This is the second highest possible score possible behind “Good”. \n\nThe Tundra also earned “Acceptable” to “Marginal” ratings for the driver-side small overlap front test, and its headlights earned a“Marginal” rating for visibility.\n\nSome reviewers found the Tundra’s less than optimal performance in each of these tests opportunities for this car’s competitors to offer better safety. \n\nEvery Toyota Tundra features a rear view cameras, Toyota Safety Sense P and Safety Star Systems. These safety features offer stability and traction control, brake- force distribution adjustments, anti-lock brakes, smart-stop technology, pre-collision alerts, lane departure alerts, automatic high beam lights, sway control and adaptive cruise control. \n\nOptional safety features in this year’s Toyota Tundra include front and rear parking sensors, rear-cross traffic alerts and blind-spot monitoring. \n\n### Driving Experience\n\nThe 2019 Toyota Tundra is available with a 4.6-liter V8 engine capable of generating 310-horsepower. The 5.7-liter V8 with 381-horsepower is available as an option in the Tundra and Tundra SR. For the Tundra Limited, Platinium and TRD Pro trims, the heavier duty 5.7-liter V8 is standard. \n\nThe Tundra’s standard V8 engines and base horsepower ratings were cited by reviewers as a feature which helps the Toyota stand out against the competition. \n\nReviewers found the Tundra’s handling to excel in the tight cornering situations typical of commercial work sites as well as busy shopping centers. With smooth and reliable braking, the Tundra offers a firm and stable ride. \n\nDesigned to handle rugged, backcountry driving with ease, the Tundra stands up to the task. A stiffer suspension allows for smoother riding over harsh terrain. \n\nThe Tundra has rear-wheel drive with the option to upgrade to four-wheel drive for an additional $3,000. The Toyota TRD Pro trim is only available in the four-wheel drive setup. \n\n### Fuel efficiency\n\nManaging just 15 miles per gallon in the city and 19 on the highway, fuel efficiency is not one of the Tundra’s high points. Reviewers found the Tundra’s V8 engines to offer some of the lowest fuel economy ratings of any full-size pickup truck. The Tundra has a fuel tank capacity of 28 gallons. There is an option to upgrade the fuel tank to 38 gallons. \n\nThough the V8 engine of the Tundra is extremely capable for handling the tough situations it was designed for, it does so a at a cost. When compared to competitors such as the V6 powered Ford F-150, the Tundra offers lower fuel economy and towing capacity. \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Pricing & Value\n\nThe 2019 Toyota Tundra can be configured in more than 24 ways thanks to possible differences between trims, cab styles, bed sizes, and powertrain upgrades. Starting between $31,520 and $50,530 for the SR, SR5, Limited, Platinum, TRD Pro, the Tundra offers a ton of customization options across its trim levels that all impact pricing and value in their own ways. \n\nThe SR5 and Limited are the only trim levels available with either the Double Cab or CrewMax Cab options. The Tundra SR has a Double Cab as a standard feature. The upper trim’s TRD Pro, Platinum are each only available in a CrewMax Cab. \n\nDouble Cab Tundras are matched with either a 6-foot-6-inch standard bed or 8-foot-1-inch long bed. CrewMax trucks are only available with a 5-foot-6-inch short bed.\n\nThe Toyota TRD Pro, back for 2019 is a great option for those seeking to push a truck through tough off-road driving situations. Reviewers found the Toyota Tundra SR5 CrewMax trim to represent a great value for those looking for a daily driving truck. \n\n__Toyota Tundra SR__\n\nStarting at $31, 520, the 4.6-liter V8 Tundra SR comes with a 6-foot-6-inch standard bed, fabric seats, 18-inch steel wheels, 6.1 inch touch screen infotainment panel, and push-start ignition.  \n\nStandard safety features include adaptive cruise control, pedestrian detection, automatic high beam headlights, and a  pre-collision alert system. \n\nThis trim can be upgraded to include the 5.7-liter V8 engine for an additional $1,270, longer truck bed for $1,6000 and four-wheel drive for $3,050. \n\n__Toyota Tundra SR5__\n\nThe Toyota Tundra SR5 offers an enlarged 7-inch touch screen infotainment panel, halogen fog lights, and satellite radio.

      "body": "### Summary\n\nThe 2019 Chevrolet Camaro is a rear wheel drive sports car available in both coupe and convertible versions.  \n\nReviewers often refer to it as a muscle car, forcing it into a class comprised of two other iconic American sports cars with which it directly competes: The Ford Mustang and Dodge Challenger.  \n\nIt more loosely competes with cars like the [Subaru BRZ](https://www.autolist.com/subaru-brz), [Toyota 86](https://www.autolist.com/scion-fr+s), [Mazda MX-5 Miata](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-mx+5+miata), [BMW](https://www.autolist.com/bmw) M2, Lexus LC and RC, [Honda Civic Si](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic-si), [Jaguar F Type](https://www.autolist.com/jaguar-f+type), and the new [Toyota Supra](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-supra). This is mainly due to the Camaro’s wide range of engine options and performance capabilities.  \n\nThe Camaro is currently in its sixth generation.  \n\nIn 2019, Chevy gave the Camaro a front end aesthetic refresh and an upgrade to their new infotainment 3 system. Additionally, the 1LE track package is now an available option for the cars equipped with the four cylinder engine. This addition essentially makes the turbo 1LE like a new car.  \n\nThe SS models with the automatic transmission now feature an optional 10-speed transmission rather than the base 8-speed.  \n\nThe base model with the turbocharged four cylinder engine provides a healthy 275 horsepower. The top ZL1 trim offers a supercharged V8 engine which provides 650 horsepower. With so many options in between, there is much to like about what it can offer potential buyers. And with a plethora of technology and convenience options available as well, the 2019 Camaro is reported to offer an up to date driving experience.  \n\n### Exterior\n\nThe front fascia refresh of the 2019 Camaro was the most noticeable change to the car but was also the most controversial. After the facelift was revealed, it was received by most reviewers with mixed feelings, including the general public.\n\n![2019-chevrolet-camaro-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3sLbWzTMcXzwUict8aU2RW/2975d30fd9ebca4913327114ac8c70f2/2019-chevrolet-camaro-exterior1.jpg)\n\nThe Camaro does still look like a sports car should. Its headlights are thin and purposeful. The windows are mounted high on the doors and are narrow, adding to the “ready to pounce” design. The rear fenders are also flared, providing a stance that compliments its sleek design. \n\nVarious trim levels and packages which include front and rear spoilers, Brembo brakes, upgraded tires, and an array of wheel options add an edgy presence to the already sporty appearance of the Camaro.\n\n![2019-chevrolet-camaro-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3W3AhpIKsCDVO53yGzEjTr/aa94c8add5855ca025d6542b999db4d6/2019-chevrolet-camaro-exterior2.jpg)\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nInterior quality is noted to be neither stellar nor lacking while comfort is good for the class.\n\n![2019-chevrolet-camaro-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/ihtAYJ9T6NNvmZloUudQa/7dfda4e2bf113b45175636139efc1b50/2019-chevrolet-camaro-interior1.jpg)\n\nBecause the windows are so small, the cabin seems smaller than it is. Consequently, visibility has been one of the most well-documented complaints about the Camaro for years.  \n\nThe seats are comfortable and supportive. Upgrading to the Recaro seat option takes away some of the comfort but adds support for more spirited driving. Conversely, the magnetic ride control offered on higher trim levels provides a smoother driving experience over long periods while also being able to adapt to harsher driving conditions.\n\n### Utility & Practicality \n\nPracticality and utility are both low, which is typical for a sports car.  \n\nCargo space in the Camaro comes in behind both the Ford Mustang and Dodge Challenger at only 9.1 cubic feet. The trunk opening is also small. The convertible version of the Camaro cuts down on trunk space even more.  \n\nThe rear seats fold down for longer items, but they are more appropriate for additional cargo space when not folded. Upright, they are tight and not well-suited for additional passengers. The Camaro does come with a LATCH child seat system.  \n\nLegroom again falls behind the Mustang but beats out the Challenger with 43.9 inches available in the front seats.\n\n![2019-chevrolet-camaro-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7AB8ZSIFoiXrUFBIpfU4I9/33a7bb1b9f6529d66c2a5dd98518f08e/2019-chevrolet-camaro-interior2.jpg)\n\n### Technology & Infotainment\n\nThe 2019 Chevy Camaro offers well-rounded technology options for its buyers.  \n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto are both standard, even on the base trim. A 7-inch touchscreen display, 4GE LTE Wifi connectivity, Bluetooth, a back up camera, cruise control, drive mode selection, and OnStar are all standard equipment.  \n\nA host of upgrades are available throughout the trim levels of the Camaro.  \n\nThe base convertible trim adds remote start and satellite radio to the mix.  \n\nThe Technology Package adds a 9-speaker Bose audio system with an upgraded 8-inch touchscreen MyLink Chevrolet Infotainment System.    \n\nMoving even higher through the trim levels provides leather upholstery, heated and ventilated seating, dual zone automatic climate controls, and GPS navigation. The most luxurious features the Camaro offers include a heated steering wheel, automatic dimming mirrors, a heads-up display, memory functions for the driver’s seat, and a sunroof.  \n\nBuyers who prioritize performance over luxury can opt for a performance exhaust, a 10-speed automatic transmission, a track data recorder, launch control, and upgraded track suspension on the highest of trim levels.  \n\n### Safety & Driving Assistance\n\nSafety and driving assistance features are well-represented for Camaro buyers. Unfortunately, most of the safety features which are standard in many new vehicles are optional upgrades or are only available on the higher trim levels of the Camaro.  \n\nStandard features include a backup camera, traction control, and advanced stability control. The Camaro did also earn a five-star safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  \n\nOptional safety and driver assistance features include forward collision alert, rear cross-traffic alert, rear parking sensors, a rearview mirror camera, and blind spot monitoring.  \n\nAutomatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, and automatic cruise control are not offered on any trim level.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nReviewers of the Camaro note its competence in acceleration, handling, and braking. Edmunds even goes as far as to call the driving experience, “fun.”  \n\nChevrolet offers four engine options for the Camaro:  \n\n- the turbocharged, four cylinder engine provides 275 horsepower and 295 lb-ft. of torque  \n\n- the naturally aspirated V6 engine provides 335 horsepower and 284 lb-ft. of torque  \n\n- the naturally aspirated V8 engine provides 455 horsepower and 455 lb-ft. of torque  \n\n- the supercharged V8 engine provides 650 horsepower and 650 lb-ft. of torque  \n\nThough the V8 engine options are the most notable for the Camaro and the muscle car segment, testers of the car from Motor Trend, Kelly Blue Book, and Car and Driver note that the four and six cylinder options have plenty of power.  \n\nHandling is said to be tight and precise, and the optional suspension upgrades make handling even better. Though testers preferred the V8 engine, they noted that the V6 was an especially competent alternative.  \n\nThe manual transmission option adds an additional enhancement to the driving experience while strong acceleration for each engine option is solid for the class.  \n\nWith so many performance options available, the Camaro is highly customizable. It can be used for a daily commute, a fun weekend at the track, or a little bit of both.  \n\n### Fuel efficiency\n\nFuel economy is not a top priority for the segment, but the four cylinder engine provides a great option for those who want fun and efficiency. It bests the Ecoboost Mustang by providing an EPA estimated 20 miles per gallon in the city and 30 miles per gallon on the highway when equipped with the manual transmission. The automatic provides two more miles per gallon in the city and one more on the highway.     \n\nThe V6 comes in slightly worse with an EPA estimated 16 and 27 miles per gallon in the city and the highway respectively with the manual transmission. The automatic adds three more miles per gallon to both estimates. The V6-powered Dodge Challenger SXT receives nearly identical numbers to the Camaro with a slightly better highway average.  \n\nThe V8 Camaro SS with the 10-speed automatic transmission matches the V6 gas mileage with a manual transmission. The manual Camaro SS drops to 16 miles per gallon in city driving and 27 in highway driving.  \n\nThe most powerful Camaro ZL1 gets an EPA rated 14 miles per gallon in the city and 20 on the highway. The automatic provides one less mile per gallon in the city but one more on the highway.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Pricing & Value\n\nThe Camaro provides fantastic value regardless of the trim level.  \n\nThe V8 engine options provide especially good value for their price to performance ratio. Additionally, the ability to apply the 1LE performance package to the four and six cylinder models is able to drastically improve the Camaro’s sporting credentials for just a few thousand dollars extra without having the downsides of a large V8 engine.  \n\nIt has evolved into a competent and easily modifiable performance machine for less than the German and Japanese competition.  \n\nEven the base Camaro is widely regarded as a good first sports car.  \n\nChevrolet offers the Camaro in seven different trim levels. You can get any trim in a convertible. You may also pair the 1LE performance package with any trim, though the convertible and 1LE Performance Package aren’t compatible.  \n\nThe 1LE Performance Package for the LS and LT trims adds a tuned suspension, limited slip differential, wider tires, larger wheels, an improved cooling system, and larger brakes.  Recaro seats, a dual mode exhaust system, and a track data recorder are optional on only certain trims throughout the lineup with the 1LE package.  \n\nThe RS package can be paired with the LT trims and includes larger wheels, a spoiler, improved front aesthetics, and can be combined with the increased cooling and braking capabilities that come with the 1LE package.  \n\n__Chevy Camaro 1LS__\n\nThe 1LS is the base model Camaro. MSRP is around $26,000 after destination fees. The four cylinder, turbocharged engine is standard and mated to a six-speed manual transmission. An 8-speed automatic transmission is optional.  \n\nStandard equipment includes LED daytime running lights, 18-inch alloy wheels, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay with a 7-inch touchscreen display, keyless entry and start, OnStar, cruise control, and a backup camera. A limited slip differential also comes standard on all manual transmission Camaros.  \n\n__Chevy Camaro 1LT__\n\nThe LT trim one-ups the LS and starts at about $26,500 with destination included. The four cylinder, turbocharged engine is still standard, but a V6 engine is available. Features added to the 1LT from the base 1LS include remote start, a power-adjustable passenger seat, and paddle shifters for automatic transmission models.  \n\n__Chevy Camaro 2LT__\n\nThe Camaro 2LT starts at about $28,500, with destination, and adds leather seating, heated and cooled seating, and dual zone climate controls. The Technology Package can be added to both the 1LT and 2LT to include a 9-speaker Bose audio system as well as an 8-inch MyLink touchscreen infotainment display.  \n\n__Chevy Camaro 3LT __ \n\nThe 3LT trim starts at nearly $32,000, including destination, and receives the V6 engine as standard. Navigation is added to the list of options.  \n\nThe Convenience and Lighting Package is also available for the 3LT which includes a power memory driver seat, heated steering wheel, a heads-up display, parking sensors, and a wireless phone charging system. Additional safety features including forward collision warning, cross traffic alert, and blind spot monitoring are also added.  \n\n__Chevy Camaro 1SS __\n\nThe Chevrolet Camaro SS is the lowest trim level to receive the V8 engine. A 6-speed manual transmission with downshift rev-matching is still standard, but buyers can opt for a 10-speed automatic transmission. Prices start at just under $38,000 with destination included.  \n\nStandard equipment includes HID headlights, upgraded suspension, upgraded engine cooling, upgraded brakes, 20-inch wheels, “track mode”, and a rear spoiler.  \n\nThe 1LE Performance Package on the SS and higher trim levels adds even larger brakes and cooling system than the lower trim levels’ 1LE, along with magnetic ride suspension.  \n\n__Chevy Camaro 2SS__\n\nThe 2SS starts at $43,000 with destination. It features the optional Convenience and Lighting package available on the 3LT trim, but with some different aesthetic features.  \n\n__Chevy Camaro ZL1 __ \n\nThe ZL1 is the top of the line trim offered for the Camaro. It starts at almost $63,000 with destination included. A supercharger is added to the engine to bring power to 650 horsepower.  \n\nLaunch control is added as a feature as well as the Extreme Track Performance option. This provides a wider tire setup, forged wheels, carbon fiber hood and spoiler, and race-tuned suspension.\n\n### More Photos\n\nSee more [2019 Chevy Camaro Photos](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-camaro/2019-chevrolet-camaro-photos).",

      "body": "Buying a new-to-you vehicle -- whether it's new or used -- is a major purchase and one you want to do correctly. While there are many benefits to buying used, doing so also means you'll want to take a peek into the vehicle's background as part of your research before making a decision. After all, even a cheap used car is still a big purchase that's worth pursuing carefully.\n\n![AutoCheck vs Carfax](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2sA13nBcnYsf9KA3icDMLz/e11a7a6a8cff33a6d77cc55132be4c09/autocheck-vs-carfax.jpg)\n\n## The Options\n\nThere are two primary companies that provide information about used cars: AutoCheck and Carfax.\n\nBoth are subscription services and they both deliver a thorough look into the history of a vehicle's service records, potential accidents and emissions records. A vehicle history report will also show salvage titles and other red flags for used vehicles, such as branded titles (sometimes also called salvage titles). \n\nBoth services draw information from the __National Motor Vehicle Title Information System__ (NMVTIS), which is run by the federal Department of Justice. This agency collects its title information from state motor vehicle registries. It's the only publicly-available system in the U.S. that all insurance carriers, auto recyclers, junk yards and salvage yards must report to regularly.\n\nIn other words, both Carfax and Autocheck let you analyze the vehicle's past so you can make an informed purchase. They're very similar services, but there are some key differences you should understand before selecting one.\n\n## Top Things to Know\n\nWhile both Carfax and AutoCheck are useful services, they're only as good as the documentation they're provided. If a body shop makes repairs and fails to update the vehicle's history, that incident won't show up in your report. Likewise, if someone has had a fender-bender and fixes their vehicle themselves or privately without telling the insurance company, you won't see that on the report either.\n\nUnfortunately, this means that a vehicle could theoretically have prior damage without it showing up in the report. Nevertheless, it’s a good idea to obtain a vehicle history report prior to buying a used car.\n\nReports from AutoCheck and Carfax do cost money, particularly if you're buying a used vehicle privately since there won't be a dealer involved who often offers a report from one of these services as part of the sale.\n\nIf you're at the dealership and want to know the history of a given car, request the report. Dealers usually have subscriptions to AutoCheck or Carfax and will run a free report for seriously interested buyers. It __should be considered a red flag__ if any seller -- dealer or private party -- refuses to run a report or provide you with an outdated report.\n\nHere's a look at Carfax versus AutoCheck:\n\n## Carfax\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ivHdfVHCHSw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nCarfax is more well-known than Autocheck and is so named because the company was founded in 1984, before the Internet, when it faxed reports to customers. Both Carfax and Autocheck reports are available on used vehicles and light trucks manufactured in 1981 and beyond.\n\n__Unique Data__\n\nCarfax offers features that Autocheck doesn’t, such as their guaranteed buyback program and information on open recalls. With the guaranteed buyback program, if they made a mistake on your vehicle history report, they will buy the vehicle back from you. For many used car buyers, that kind of reassurance is well-worth the higher cost of admission. \n\n__A Bit More Costly__\n\nCarfax is the more expensive option: As of this writing, a single Carfax report (for a single vehicle) cost $39.99, three costs $59.99 and six is $99.99. For comparison, AutoCheck charges $24.99 for one or $49.99 for 25 reports in 21 days. \n\nWith those prices in mind, if you plan on casting a wide net and comparing many similar vehicles, Autocheck is clearly the more frugal option. However, if you just want to learn in-depth details about one specific vehicle, it may be worth spending a little extra for Carfax's extra features and data.\n\nAlthough they cost more, Carfax reports tend to be __highly detailed__ yet easier to understand, making them more user-friendly. Data such as mileage and the number of owners a vehicle has had are clearly labeled and neatly organized into sections. \n\n__Includes Service & Maintenance Records__\n\nFurthermore, Carfax is also the only report to show records such as maintenance dates, provided that the vehicle was serviced in a facility that shares this type of data, like the service department for a franchised dealership. This lets you see how well previous owners cared for the car, as well as any issues it may have had.\n\nCarfax receives data from over 100,000 sources, including every United States and Canadian provincial motor vehicle agency. Carfax also receives data from less common sources too, including auto auctions, police and fire departments, and collision repair shops. In North America alone, the Carfax database contains over 17.5 billion records.\n\nOf course, when it comes to vehicle data, quality matters too. Carfax reports provide a wide range of information, including information that you may not find on Autocheck reports.\n\n### Example Data You'll Find on Carfax\n\nHere are some examples of the type of data you'll find on a Carfax report:\n\n__Title Information__\n\nYou can discover if the car has a junk, flood, branded title or salvage title, or if it's ever been used as part of a commercial fleet. This provides insight into how the vehicle was used (and possibly abused), which helps to shed light on what you can expect from it in the future. After all, even if there's no structural damage, it's wise to learn about any wear and tear that may have taken its toll on the vehicle's many components.\n\n__Odometer Readings__\n\nCarfax also provides TIMA (Truth in Mileage Act)-certified odometer readings. This information lets you proceed with confidence, knowing that the odometer hasn't been fraudulently adjusted. \n\n__Lemons and Buybacks__\n\nIn the United States, Carfax reports also show lemon titles and manufacturer buybacks, helping you to avoid vehicles that have been problematic in the past. They also show where the vehicle was originally registered and used, giving you a better idea of the kind of conditions it has been exposed to.\n\n__Transfers of Ownership__\n\nCarfax reports also detail any transfers of ownership. After all, if the vehicle has had many owners, there's probably a reason. If the vehicle has a lien against it, your Carfax report will acknowledge it so you don't accidentally purchase property that technically doesn't belong to the seller due to outstanding debt. Carfax also lets you know if the vehicle is or has been stolen.\n\n__Inspections and Repairs__\n\nYou can also find information on when and where a car was inspected, including whether it passed or failed safety and emissions inspections. You can also learn about any maintenance records, repairs or other service history. If the vehicle has a consistent history of needing repairs, it may be prudent to look elsewhere. Carfax also lets you know if a vehicle has been recalled so you can make sure that any repairs or exchanges have already been completed.\n\n__Accidents__\n\nAdditionally, Carfax is guaranteed to have information about severe accidents, and Carfax offers the largest publicly accessible database of smaller accident reports that may not be reported elsewhere. That said, smaller accidents aren't guaranteed to show up on Carfax reports. Some accidents simply aren't reported, and others may be reported to agencies that don't provide Carfax with data.\n\n## AutoCheck\n\nAutoCheck is owned by Experian and it has relationships with industry leaders including CarMax (different than Carfax), eBay Motors, Edmunds.com, NADAguides.com, and Kelley Blue Book. This company __assigns each vehicle a numerical score__ (similar to a credit score for cars) within a range for similar examples of the same vehicle, age and mileage.\n\n__AutoCheck Score__\n\nThe score is intended to demonstrate how well the vehicle stacks up against other available cars in its class. This allows you to quickly weed out any vehicles with issues, which can be as benign as high mileage and repossessions or as serious as damage from one or more reported accidents. It will also let you know whether the car was ever used by police or taxi services.\n\nThese scores pay close attention to collision data, giving potential buyers a thorough look at what's happened (if anything) in the vehicle's past that might warrant concern.\n\nUnfortunately, the scale can be a little confusing, and how AutoCheck determines those numbers isn't particularly obvious. Those who prefer a highly detailed report may want to spend a little extra on Carfax reports. However, those who aren't as technically savvy may find that a simple numerical score streamlines the process and makes the information more easily digestible. It's largely a matter of preference.\n\n__Unique to AutoCheck: Auction Data__\n\nOne of AutoCheck's key advantages over Carfax is that it has exclusive access to auction data from the two largest United States auctions, giving prospective buyers a more comprehensive look at a vehicle's history (this is why their reports have a better reputation with used car dealers).\n\nFurthermore, AutoCheck lets their subscribers run up to 300 reports using VIN numbers (Vehicle Identification Number) from a desktop or tablet computer – or even a smartphone. As of this writing, Carfax did not offer any similar service.\n\nAutocheck provides much of the same information as Carfax, however __its database is not as large__. That said, some data available from Autocheck may not be available on Carfax too, so you may want to consider getting reports from both platforms just to be thorough.\n\n### Example Data You'll Find on AutoCheck:\n\nAutocheck provides registration and title data from all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia. The platform also delivers collision records from police reports and other sources, as well as event data from insurance companies and salvage yards.\n\n__Frequent Problem Area Checks__\n\nAutocheck checks for records of the vehicle being abandoned, damaged, junked or scrapped. Any major incidents reported to relevant databases are acknowledged. The platform also reports any documented fire, hail or water damage, as well as any frame or structural damage or odometer damage.\n\nThe platform also delivers any relevant records pertaining to the vehicle's relation with the grey market, recycling facilities or insurance loss or probable total loss. Autocheck delivers records of manufacturer buybacks or lemons, as well as reports on whether the vehicle is rebuilt or rebuildable. \n\n__NHTSA Data__\n\nAutocheck also provides any relevant NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) records that may be associated with the car, like branded title data. That way you can buy with confidence, knowing that your vehicle has passed safety standards.\n\n__Lower Cost__\n\nAs we mentioned, AutoCheck is cheaper than Carfax; a current single report is $24.99, 25 reports over 21 days is $49.99 and the 300-limit plan is $99.99. That's why many dealers use Autocheck. It's undoubtedly the more frugal option, however, the reports aren't as robust.\n\n## Which to Choose\n\nFirst of all, you may not need to decide. If you're buying through a dealer, broker or online service, it's likely that they will offer a report from one or both of these services. For example, Autolist often lists cars that come with free Carfax reports included. \n\nWhile Carfax reports are more expensive, we believe that potential buyers have the right to as much information as possible. Carfax reports simply offer more information, and when it comes to buying a used car, knowledge is power.\n\nBoth data sources do offer similar benefits, however. So, if you simply want to make sure that the car isn't stolen, for example, you may find choosing the cheaper option: Autocheck.\n\n__What Are Your Goals?__\n\nTo determine the best course of action, start by reviewing your goals. Do you want a highly detailed overview of the vehicle, or do you simply want to check to make sure the sale is legitimate?\n\nAre you spending a significant amount of money on a long-term daily driver, or are you simply getting the cheapest possible beater to get you from point A to B? Are you seeking a particular vehicle, or are you willing to take whatever fits your budget?\n\nThose who are making a serious investment would be wise to use Carfax or both platforms. The extra cost of Carfax gives you priceless peace of mind, knowing that you've used the most comprehensive option. Even if you're not actively seeking specific information, you may be surprised when new details show up that you didn't expect.\n\nAt the same time, Autocheck is still a very handy tool that may accomplish everything you need and more -- especially if you want a numerical Autocheck score that sums up the information for you. Just make sure that the information you're seeking is, in fact, covered by Autocheck's database.\n\nFinally, if you're browsing many different cars, it may make more sense to use Autocheck's 25 or 300-limit plan. That way you have the freedom to generate reports on any vehicle that sparks your interest, without having to dwell on the cost. After all, if you're spending some time finding that perfect ride, the cost of paying for each individual report adds up fast.\n\n## Both Reports Aren't Perfect\n\nWhile there's no denying that both Carfax and Autocheck reports are extremely useful, it's important to remember that both reports are limited to their databases, meaning that even the most detailed reports could be missing certain information.\n\nCarfax receives data from more organizations, so if there's an undisclosed issue with the vehicle, you're more likely to find it there. Additionally, Carfax does state that if there's a mistake on your vehicle history report, they will buy the vehicle back from you.\n\nHowever, even using both Carfax and Autocheck doesn't guarantee that you're going to discover every existing or potential issue. Some issues may have never been reported, or Carfax or Autocheck may not have access to certain information.\n\nThere's always going to be a certain amount of risk involved in buying used vehicles. The trick is to use tools like these to mitigate the risk. The odds are in your favor. After all, between both platforms, you have access to a tremendous amount of information. Just try not to depend on them as your only source of information.\n\nWhen it comes to learning about a car's history, it's wise to shop at reputable car lots and online platforms. You may be able to get a great deal buying through an independent seller, but there's more risk involved too.\n\nIf you do decide to buy from an independent dealer, communication is key. Spend some time researching the vehicle. Learn about common issues related to that specific model. Once you're armed with knowledge, you can ask the seller questions.\n\nOf course, there's no guarantee that a seller is going to be honest about the vehicle's history. At the same time, simply showing that you're an informed shopper is often enough to encourage sellers to be more transparent.\n\n## Start with Free Reports\n\nIn many cases you'll get one or both reports for free.  For example, here at Autolist, our platform gives you access to thousands of new and used car listings, as well as detailed information such as how long the car has been for sale and how its price compares to similar cars. That way you can make an informed decision on how to proceed.  In many cases dealers listing their vehicles on [Autolist](https://www.autolist.com) will provide a free Carfax report. \n\n__Free Carfax report example on Autolist:__\n\n![autolist-carfax-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1n6a7BUytGeuciu4iKqEm/1f49c7ee091ceb6d282fafd9a378feb3/autolist-carfax-image.jpg)\n\nIf you're shopping elsewhere and the seller doesn't offer a report and you're serious about buying a specific vehicle from them -- ask them to provide you one for free. Many sellers will provide one gladly; just make sure that you're genuinely interested in the vehicle, as the seller may have to pay for the report out of pocket.\n\nIf you're buying privately or the seller declines to make a report available, it's up to you if you want to spend the money. However, if the seller isn't willing to pay for the report, you may want to look elsewhere. \n\nAfter all, while there's nothing wrong with pinching pennies, a good seller recognizes a buyer's need for details. If they're not providing as many details as possible, there might be a reason. \n\nIf your dealer refuses to work with you to help you make an informed purchase, you may want to find a seller with a better reputation and a more buyer-friendly approach (especially if you're not well-versed int he automotive industry.\n\n## Get Both\n\nAt the end of the day, it never hurts to have as much information as possible. After all, even a relatively cheap used car is still a major purchase.\n\nWhen you look at the big picture, paying a little bit of extra money for these reports isn't going to make a big difference in your overall spending, and the information gained can go a long way in protecting your investment as a car buyer.\n\nWhen it comes down to Carfax vs. Autocheck, both companies enjoy excellent reputations in the industry and can provide you with important information. It's up to you to determine if an Autocheck report is enough to meet your needs, or if you prefer a more robust detailing of the vehicle in question.\n\nAutoCheck's 25 reports in 21 days plan can be an economical way to check the history of a variety of vehicles you're interested in. Autocheck vehicle history reports may not be as detailed, but if you only need basic information or a simple rating, often they're just fine.\n\nCarFax, meanwhile, gives you a great look at the service history of a vehicle so you have a keen sense of what work a car has had done and what work you might need to be prepared for. If you're buying a more expensive vehicle, or if you're just highly detail-oriented, a Carfax report may be ideal for you.\n\n### A Small Investment\n\nFor around $65, you're buying comprehensive peace of mind, which is a bargain for any vehicle. Research the vehicle independently beforehand, and only buy reports for cars that you're genuinely considering purchasing. ",

      "body": "Autolist rating: __4/5__\nBut would we buy it? __Yep!__\nPrice range: __$32,300-$39,350__, before destination and options\n\n## Key takeaways\n\n- The UX was an all-new model for 2019.\n- It’s smaller than the long-running Lexus RX crossover and newer NX.\n- Comes with either a gas or hybrid powertrain, though all-wheel drive is only offered for hybrid models.\n- An athletic F Sport package is available, and it adds larger wheels and minor upgrades to the interior.\n- The UX has limited cargo space and tight back seat room.\n\n![2020-lexus-ux-image-5](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7gDDOy5RcT7aREGfmOkOlt/6b6608c7f645186d38e86938b98d2b78/2020-lexus-ux-image-5.jpg) \n\n---\n\n## What is it?\n\nThe UX is a new crossover from Lexus for the 2019 model year. It slots into the lineup below the NX and RX crossovers as the smallest and most affordable crossover the brand makes. It’s aimed at new car buyers that want a compact premium SUV at a reasonable price, and it’s offered in both a gas and a hybrid model. \n\nEach model is available in three trims: base, F Sport, and the range-topping Luxury trim. Just like everywhere else in the crossover world, the compact luxury segment has become ultra-competitive over the past few years; the UX’s main competitors are the Volvo XC40, BMW X2, Mercedes GLA, Infiniti QX30, and the Audi Q3.\n\nThe UX F Sport, like other Lexus “F” models, comes with sport seats, sportier suspension, and other design touches that make it more aggressive than the other models. The powertrain remains untouched, though, as the F Sport trim is an appearance-only upgrade.\n\nGas-powered models all have a 2.0-liter inline-four cylinder that makes 169 horsepower, routed to the front wheels via a CVT gearbox that mimics a 10-speed automatic transmission.\n \nUX Hybrid models come with a 2.0-liter engine with a hybrid system that makes 181 total system horsepower. All-wheel-drive is standard for hybrid UX models, and like its gas brethren, this hybrid uses a CVT gearbox. \n\n![2020-lexus-ux-image-4](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6qO9nBOweTrzWEiBCB3ble/494b4061054b03be159254209bd1b411/2020-lexus-ux-image-4.jpg) \n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n## What’s good?\n*TLDR: Solid fuel economy, an upscale interior, and a luxury-quality ride all rolled up in a compact package.*\n\n__Ride:__ The UX’s size and stance might lead you to believe that it’s a sporty and athletic crossover, but the ride is subdued and luxurious. There are very few bumps and bangs that the UX’s suspension can’t handle, and it’s quite serene on long trips. \n\n __Fuel Economy:__ A small crossover is expected to deliver decent fuel economy, and UX hits the mark here. The gas-powered model is rated by the EPA at 29/37/33 MPG city/highway/combined, while the hybrid models reach 41/38/39 mpg with all-wheel drive. Those numbers aren’t just competitive for crossovers; they’re reaching into compact sedan territory.\n\n__Interior:__ Though there’s cloth in the most basic models, the two-tone interiors found in upgraded trims is comfortable and feels like it’s meant for a more expensive vehicle. The leatherette upholstery feels premium and remains comfy on long haul drives. The F Sport trim has heavily bolstered sport seats that may be too tight for larger people, but are otherwise very comfortable. \n\n![2020-lexus-ux-image-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1PK1eAznz0Ac5MScEZCzVu/191570b116732f24e858c457529be0cb/2020-lexus-ux-image-1.jpg) \n\n---\n\n## What’s bad?\n\n\n\n*TLDR: Underpowered, wonky infotainment system.*\n\n__Terrible Infotainment:__ The UX is one of the first Lexus or Toyota vehicles to get Apple CarPlay, and it also has a great deal of standard tech and safety features. Even so, basic operation of the infotainment system is infuriating and confusing. There are a variety of menus to sift through, and the touchpad system is more than burdensome, especially when the vehicle is on the move. It’s too distracting to use in almost any situation and draws attention away from the road. \n\n![2020-lexus-ux-image-7](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7hA4MUQAgxsA3Ka2NWJeWN/ce1c57430ab2d4ca3fc3f302c965edb7/2020-lexus-ux-image-7.jpg)\n\n__Underwhelming power:__ It’s clear that the UX was designed with fuel economy in mind, as it often feels like there’s not enough power on tap. The standard four-cylinder engine doesn’t move off the line very quickly but is competent at highway speeds once it gets there. The hybrid delivers 181 horsepower, which sounds like more but still won’t inspire many giggles with the pedal to the floor. \n\n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n## 5 stars of execution:\nSafety Features? __YES__\n- Lexus was generous with the advanced safety tech for the new UX. There’s automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warnings, and lane-keep assist\n- The UX earned a Top Safety Pick rating from the IIHs and five stars from the NHTSA.\n\nValue? __YES__\n- Even as the cheapest Lexus SUV -- starting at $32,000 -- you get a lot for your money. \n- Options packages are a steal. The $1,175 Premium Package adds blind-spot monitors, a moonroof, rain-sensing wipers, and heated/ventilated seats. The larger infotainment screen and navigation costs $1,025.\n- The UX’s MSRP beats all of its competitors’ pricing, handily in some cases, as the BMW X1 starts around $35,000, and the Volvo XC40 starts at around $34,000.\n\nEfficiency? __YES__\n- Without the hybrid, the UX hits an EPA-estimated 29/37/33 mpg city/highway/combined, and hybrid models are rated at 43/41/42 mpg\n- Those numbers beat the BMW X1 and Audi Q3, and compete with several sedans and economy cars\n\n![2020-lexus-ux-image-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1ar5c8X4eYueI0Z9kF8CST/d3c4e2cc3509798b1129ed7a59f33cb2/2020-lexus-ux-image-3.jpg) \n\nDriving experience? __NO__ \n- As we mentioned, the UX is underpowered, no matter how you cut it. Even the hybrid could use a few more horses. That said, power delivery does even out after a bit, and passing once at highway speed presents no challenges.\n- The UX feels larger than it is, thanks to suspension tuned for comfort instead of performance, which isn’t a terrible thing. The handling is confidence-inspiring, however, especially with the hybrid models’ AWD on board.\n- The UX uses a CVT that has trick tech to make it feel and act like a 10-speed automatic. It’s a clever transmission that performs much better than other continuously-variable gearboxes, but the driving experience would be much better with a normal automatic.\n\nExecution? __YES__\n- The packaging and pricing for the UX are spot-on and make the UX a solid entry point to the Lexus lineup\n- The interior is quality and truly feels more expensive than it is. Head and legroom are adequate, even for such a small vehicle, and there’s not a bad seat in the house from a comfort perspective\n- Lexus’ stellar reliability and entry-level luxury come at a reasonable price\n\n## Total Rating: 4 stars\n\n\n--- \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\n\nThe base Lexus UX 200 has a base price of $32,300 before destination, and comes with front-wheel drive, push-button start/stop, selectable drive modes, a 7-inch infotainment screen, a six-speaker premium stereo, a WiFi hotspot, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto capability, four USB ports, Bluetooth, voice controls, dual-zone climate controls, synthetic leather upholstery, folding rear seats, LED headlights, and Lexus advanced safety systems that add forward-collision warnings, and other features like pedestrian detection.\n\n\n\nThe UX 250h adds all-wheel drive and the aforementioned hybrid powertrain, and it has the same features as the base gas model, with a starting price of $34,350 before destination.\n\n![2020-lexus-ux-image-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2ylEymgGJi3UR9PPNDhqgj/5dc89dd35ecce43888c447294874ef2c/2020-lexus-ux-image-2.jpg) \n\nThe UX F Sport has a starting price of $34,300 before destination, and adds 18-inch split-spoke wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, LED foglamps, sport seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, paddle shifters, and digital gauges.\n\n\n\nThe UX 250h F Sport has the same features and a starting price of $36,350.\n\n\n\nThe UX Luxury has a starting price of $37,500 before destination and adds a 10.3-inch infotainment screen with navigation, memory seats, a power liftgate with foot sensors, heated and ventilated front seats, blind-spot monitors, rain-sensing windshield wipers, a power moonroof, and acoustic glass.\n\n\n\nThe Lexus UX 250h Luxury carries the same features and has a starting price of $39,350.\n\n\n\nIf it were our money, we’d buy the UX 250h F Sport, as it comes with a fuel-sipping hybrid drivetrain, all-wheel drive, a sporty interior, and an excellent hybrid powertrain.\n\n\n![2020-lexus-ux-image-6](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3LPSBJoSEHiDZ0hRBROf78/9fba59738375af4bdd18ec4c6b5387cb/2020-lexus-ux-image-6.jpg) \n\n---\n\n## Also consider:\n\n\n\nThe Audi Q3 was redesigned for 2019, and while it’s more expensive, it comes loaded up with great features and a sporty ride. It’s got all of the great stuff that its larger siblings have at a much lower price.\n\n\n\nThe BMW X1 has a solid powertrain, plenty of cargo space, and a decent price tag. It gets expensive quick with options, so the entry-level models are best. \n\n\n\nThe Infiniti QX30 has attractive styling, great handling, an upscale interior, and a good price. That said, it gets expensive with options, easily topping $40,000. The QX30 rides on the same underpinnings as the Mercedes-Benz GLA, which is similarly priced. Either could easily be confused with a slightly larger hatchback car.\n\n\n\nWe would pass on the subcompact Buick Encore, MINI Countryman, and most anything over $40,000 in this segment – looking at the Porsche Macan. At this price point, several midsize to large sedans could be considered as well, like the Lexus ES, BMW 3-Series, or Audi A4.\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "One of the most important criteria when evaluating cars is reliability. Reliable vehicles are ones that don't need frequent repairs and that last for many years if you take good care of them. Every vehicle needs regular servicing, but new cars shouldn't need a new engine or brake system for several years. Two of the most popular brands on the vehicle market are Honda and Toyota, and it's no coincidence that both Japanese automakers have reputations for reliability. Before picking a car from either brand, however, it's best to compare their dependability in detail. Here are some vehicles from Honda and Toyota that have a long history of reliability records from reputable sites.\n\n### Honda vs. Toyota Reliability: How Do The Brands Stack Up?\n\nEach year, the nonprofit organization Consumer Reports surveys half a million car buyers on the most reliable auto brands on the market. As of 2019, the most recent Consumer Reports reliability survey lists Toyota as the second most reliable car brand, below Lexus and above Mazda, and Honda as the 15th most reliable brand. Some of the more reliable brands in the survey include Subaru, Kia, Infiniti, Audi, BMW, Mini and Hyundai. Car brands of mid-range dependability include Porsche, Genesis, Acura, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Buick and Lincoln, while brands of relatively low reliability include Dodge, Jeep, Chevrolet, Chrysler, GMC, Ram, Tesla, Cadillac and Volvo.\n\nFor the last half-decade, Toyota has been at or near the top of Consumer Reports reliability surveys, while Honda's position has steadily fallen. Much of Toyota's dominance comes down to the company's consistency. The largest automaker in the world, Toyota's business model focuses on dependability over innovation, performance or flashiness. On the test track, Toyota vehicles tend to perform in the bottom third of the market, primarily because Toyota refuses to sacrifice dependability for performance. Toyotas aren't exceptionally quiet or comfortable compared to cars of other brands, but they can hold up for years before showing serious wear. According to the car research site MojoMotors.com, Toyota vehicles last 210,705 miles on average before losing almost all of their value. Another reason Toyotas score high on reliability is that Toyota keeps technological amenities such as infotainment systems to a minimum until they've been proven to work. That's because newer, more complex technology breaks down more often, harming customer satisfaction.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Reliability vs. Performance\n\nIn contrast to Toyota, Honda focuses primarily on performance. For decades, Honda's vehicles stood alongside Toyota's as some of the most reliable on the market. But in recent years the company has shifted toward making their cars as smooth, quiet and comfortable as possible, giving them powerful engines and high-tech transmissions even at the cost of reliability. Consumer Reports notes that Honda's eight- and nine-speed automatic transmissions tend to have more problems than the company's older designs. Also, the company's new turbocharged engines have proven less dependable than the previous engines. \n\nHonda also sacrificed reliability by embracing Apple CarPlay and Android Auto software earlier than most brands. CarPlay is a state-of-the-art interface that connects to the vehicle's infotainment system to provide user-friendly audio and visual outputs. Toyota only embraced Apple CarPlay in 2018 with its release of the 2019 Toyota Avalon, several years after Honda adopted the technology. By the time Toyota started using CarPlay, many of the software's flaws had been ironed out. \n\nHowever, Honda still makes much more dependable vehicles than most auto manufacturers. According to MojoMotors, the average Honda vehicle lasts 209,001 miles before becoming theoretically worthless. That's because Honda, like Toyota, has high engineering standards and top-notch manufacturing processes. For example, Honda requires its vehicle parts to fit more tightly than most automakers, ensuring they don't wear down as quickly from grinding against each other. Honda is also the largest engine maker in the world so that it can rely on economies of scale for quality control. Traditionally, Honda has also encouraged direct communication between line workers and higher-ups to ensure flaws in manufacturing are reported quickly. Like Toyota, Honda uses aggressive industrial techniques, such as root cause analysis and statistical process control, to refine production.\n\n### What Are the Most Reliable Toyota Vehicles?\n\nThe vehicle research site ReliabilityIndex.com maintains a comprehensive reliability index for hundreds of vehicles, ranking each according to factors such as the cost of repairs and how often parts fail. According to this index, the Scion iQ is the most reliable vehicle on the market. Only one generation of the Scion iQ was released in the U.S., on the market from 2012 to 2015, with relatively low sales.\n\nThe Toyota Prius is a more popular model that has also achieved an excellent reputation for reliability. The gas-electric hybrid Prius comes in both compact and subcompact classes and both four-door sedan and five-door liftback body styles. The Environmental Protection Agency considers the Prius one of the cleanest cars available, as it has low smog-forming emissions. The Prius v, an extended hatchback, and the Prius c, a subcompact hatchback, are also available for purchase. The Prius liftback is one of the best-selling hybrid cars in the world, with over 4 million sold, as of 2017. The Toyota Auris, a compact hatchback based on the Toyota Corolla, is another vehicle renowned for its dependability, particularly as a family car. Electric failures make up about a fifth of this vehicle's reliability problems. Other problems that can arise include seats that wear quickly and a decline in power whenever an exhaust gas recirculation valve gets blocked.\n\n### Other Toyota Vehicles\n\nA compact crossover SUV, the Toyota RAV4 is another reliable vehicle, with Consumer Reports regarding it as the most dependable car for its class and AutoExpress voting it the most reliable car overall. The RAV4 enjoys the fuel economy and maneuverability of much smaller vehicles while offering constant four-wheel-drive and ample cargo room. In many countries, this vehicle is the only crossover from Toyota that consumers can buy. The Toyota 4Runner, a series of compact and midsize SUVs, has a strong reputation for reliability as well. A 2019 study by the automotive research site iSeeCars.com listed the 4Runner as the fifth longest-lasting vehicle in the U.S., with nearly 4 percent of 4Runners having more than 200,000 miles. Finally, the Toyota Yaris is a highly dependable vehicle. A subcompact that's been around since 1999, the Yaris comes in two-door coupe and four-door sedan body styles along with three- and five-door hatchback body styles.\n\nNot all Toyotas are reliable, however. The Toyota Hilux series of commercial vehicles, which came in cab chassis and pickup truck styles, aren't prized for their dependability. Similarly, the Toyota Land Cruiser, a Jeep-like four-wheel-drive vehicle, and the Toyota Avensis, a series of large and midsize family cars, tend to rank low in reliability surveys.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### What Are the Most Reliable Honda Vehicles?\n\nAlthough the Honda brand doesn't score as highly as Toyota in surveys of dependability, there are plenty of very reliable Honda vehicles on offer. For example, the Honda Fit is ranked as the fifth most reliable vehicle on ReliabilityIndex.com. Released in the U.S. in 2005, the Honda Fit is a five-door hatchback subcompact with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine and continuously variable or six-speed manual transmission options. All trim levels of this vehicle also feature a rear-view backup camera. Also, the Honda Civic has proved generally reliable over several decades, with tens of millions sold worldwide since its debut in 1972. Over the years, the Honda Civic, which comes in both four-door sedan and three- and five-door hatchback styles has gotten larger and more luxurious. Consumer Reports considers the Honda Civic Coupe the most reliable variant, and the 2015 Civic Coupe, in particular, has received a lot of praise. The Civic's main reliability problems stem from its electrical systems, with the axle and suspension, engine and gearbox systems causing a fair amount of issues as well.\n\nThe Honda Accord, a series of very popular midsize vehicles now in its 10th generation, also ranks highly for reliability. According to ReliabilityIndex.com, the average Accord has 57,716 miles and is 4.57 years old. About half of the Accord's reliability problems come down to the electrical and braking systems, while the air conditioning, gearbox and axle, and suspension systems cause the rest. Another reliable Honda vehicle is the Insight, a four-door, five-passenger hybrid electric hatchback. The Insight is one of the most fuel-efficient gas-powered cars in U.S. history. Even though Insights tend to be expensive, they have low average repair costs. Almost all of the Insight's reliability problems come down to its axle and suspension system, with the steering system causing the rest of the issues.\n\n### Other Honda Vehicles\n\nIf you want a reliable Honda, you should also look at the Honda CR-V. This also-popular compact SUV was first released in 1997, using four-cylinder engines and available with either front or all-wheel-drive. According to ReliabilityIndex.com, the CR-V has an average age of 5.41 years and an average mileage of 56,027 miles. The CR-V's reliability ratings aren't as high as other Honda vehicles, and the repair costs are often steep, but the vehicle is much more dependable than most on the market. Many Honda vehicles have mid-range reliability, such as the Honda FR-V, while some have abysmal reliability, such as the Honda Odyssey. Consumer Reports notes that the Odyssey, a five-door minivan, has a reliability level well below the market average.\n\nWhen it comes to reliability, Toyota has the edge over Honda, embracing time-tested features that have proven to work instead of risky innovations that haven't. However, Honda offers several vehicles that match Toyota's for reliability, despite putting performance first. All in all, Toyota and Honda are two of the most dependable car brands on the market.",

      "body": "A valid driver's license (or learners permit) is required to drive a car, but no law says you need a license to own one. While purchasing a vehicle may seem like a strange idea if you don't have a valid license, there could be reasons why you may want to own a car. If you plan on buying a car, though, you may have to jump through some hoops. But you should be able to navigate the process fairly easily as long as you do have valid, non-driver photo identification.\n\n### Why Buy a Car Without a License to Drive It?\n\nThere are many reasons why a person may want to own a vehicle, even if they can't drive it. Some people may have a driver because they're disabled or don't enjoy driving. Business owners may want to keep ownership of a company car. Sometimes people want to give a child or loved one a vehicle while still owning it. Another common reason is that you want to own a collectible car as an asset or hobby, even if you have no intention of ever hitting the road. Or, maybe you're in the process of getting your license, and you just found an incredible deal on a great vehicle that you don't want to miss.\n\n### You Still Need a Valid Photo ID\n\nAlthough a driver's license isn't necessary to own a vehicle, government-issued photo identification is still required to get a loan, registration and auto insurance. If you don't currently possess a valid photo identification card, you will need to go to the DMV and obtain one. The requirements to get a non-drivers ID do vary from state to state, but in most cases, you need a social security card, proof of residency, and proof of identification. Contact your local Department of Motor Vehicles for information on your state's requirements.\n\n### Getting Car Insurance Without a License\n\nTo register your vehicle, you will need the bill of sale and auto insurance. Here's where things can get a little bit tricky, in some cases. Some insurance agencies will not provide a policy if you're not the primary driver, so you will need to call around and discover your options. \n\nThe reason why getting coverage without a license is hard is because there are many factors that insurance companies examine to determine your rate. Since you won't be the primary driver, an insurance company will need to base the rate on driver-specific information. That includes where they will be driving, their driving record, how many miles the vehicle will be driven annually, and their credit score. \n\nIf the primary driver has a bad record, you'll pay significantly more for an insurance policy than you would for yourself – if the insurance agency is willing to provide coverage at all. Before agreeing to a plan, be confident in the driver getting the insurance. While accidents do happen, you don't want to end up paying high premiums because a friend or family member isn't a responsible driver. \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Finding an Auto Loan Without a License\n\nA lender will not give you a car loan unless you're able to provide proof of insurance. Once you have coverage, the next step is to find a loan, assuming you won't be paying with cash or credit. Some lenders will not provide a loan without a valid driver's license. Others may consider it, but only if you prove that you're going to be able to pay for the vehicle. The reasoning behind this is that an unlicensed driver could get arrested, and then they won't be able to make payments. That's why you need to prove that you won't be driving the vehicle.\n\nIf you're looking for the best rate, a big bank may not be the best choice. They tend to have stricter rules, and if you get a loan, it may not be an ideal rate. Instead, you may want to find a credit union in your area. Credit unions tend to be more willing to work with people in unique situations. You will likely need to bring along the primary driver so you can make your case.\n\nIf you're not able to obtain a fair loan through a bank or credit union, look into other routes to get a personal loan. Sometimes, a credit card with a low introductary interest rate may cover a sizeable portion of the vehicle's price, if the seller is willing to cover the transaction fees. Getting a car without a license is possible, but as you can see, you might end up paying more if not paying with cash.\n\n### Shopping for a Car Without a License\n\nAnother difficulty associated with car buying without a license is that the dealership won't allow you to test drive a vehicle without a valid license. Naturally, this makes it challenging to make an informed purchase. The best approach is to bring the primary driver with you and allow them to test drive the vehicle. While you won't be able to feel what it's like to drive the vehicle, your driver should be able to help you determine if the car's a good buy. \n\nIf you don't have a driver — maybe you're buying a collectible car — you can bring someone you know with a license to test drive it for you. A salesperson or the seller may also be willing to take the car out with you as a passenger. Just pay close attention to any bumps, noises, or other occurrences that don't seem right.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Registering a Car Without a License\n\nThe major challenge associated with buying a car without a license is registering it. The vehicle can only be driven on public roadways if it's registered in the owner's name, meaning the name listed on the title. If the goal is to retain full ownership of the vehicle, you will need a valid driver's license for the vehicle to be street legal, even if you won't be driving it.\n\nYou have a few options. If you're buying the vehicle for business purposes, you can register it under your business entity's name, rather then your own. Anyone who drives the vehicle will need to be licensed and insured, but you (your company) will still be the sole owner. \n\nIf you're buying the vehicle for someone else, as a gift, for example, the driver will need to register the vehicle in their name. However, that does mean that they technically have legal ownership of the vehicle, even though you paid for it. If you take this approach, you must trust the driver, and you may want to consult a lawyer about a contract to protect you in case something goes awry.\n\nFinally, if you're buying a collectible car, you may not need to register it at all. States have different restrictions depending on whether the vehicle is classified as a historic or classic car. Check your local guidelines to see if your collectible car meets your state's criteria.\n\n### You May Want to Get a License Anyways\n\nIf you can, you may want to consider getting a driver's license, even if your foot is never going to touch the gas pedal. Of course, that's not always possible, but if it is, you can save a lot of time and effort. A lack of a driver's license limits your options when it comes to finding car insurance coverage, getting a loan, registering the vehicle, and shopping for a vehicle. It's possible to overcome these hurdles, but it may take more research and time.\n\nIf you plan on getting a license in the future, it's easier to wait until you have it before buying a vehicle. That way, you don't need to bother transferring ownership and adjusting your insurance policy. And you may also be able to get an auto loan with better terms.",

      "body": "__Highlights:__\n- Twenty-five percent of consumers said daylight saving time causes a significant disruption to their commute or routine.\n\n- Forty percent of those polled said daylight saving time should be abolished by the federal government. \n\n- Six percent said they’d been in a crash caused or made worse by the effects of daylight saving time.\n\n- Nearly one-third (30 percent) of respondents said they were less productive at work during the week after the time change.\n\n- Fifteen percent of consumers said they eat in the car during their commute as a result of the time change. \n\n---\n\n__Full Story:__\n\nThe end of Daylight Saving Time is fast approaching, and for those dreading the impact it has on daily routines and schedules, you’re not alone. \n\nA recent survey by Autolist.com found that many consumers are negatively impacted by the time change, which forces behavior changes that affect commuting and productivity. \n\n“While an extra hour of sleep is nice every fall, this survey made it clear that there isn’t a lot of love for the twice-annual time change overall,” said Chase Disher, analyst at Autolist. “Consumers just don’t see the few advantages outweighing the many inconveniences.”\n\nAutolist polled 1,282 current car shoppers in early October to gauge their attitudes on daylight saving time ahead of the November 3 end date for this year’s term. \n\nThe survey found daylight saving time not only affected behavior changes related to getting to work, but also concerns about productivity and safety.\n\nWith regards to commuting, a quarter (25 percent) of consumers said daylight saving time significantly disrupts their commute or routine.\n\n![Screen Shot 2019-10-21 at 10.12.51 PM](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3Dtwj7dypQ2jKyNx25zAYN/0d2e13304a21957a581ea8a27b95568e/Screen_Shot_2019-10-21_at_10.12.51_PM.png)\n\nSixteen percent of consumers said they were more inclined to eat during their driving commute, increasing the potential for distracted driving and crashes. \n\nMore troubling was the potential for an increase in car crashes. Six percent of respondents to Autolist’s survey said they had been in a car crash that was caused by or made more likely by daylight saving time. \n\nThat figure is close to what [other studies](https://www.vox.com/2016/3/13/11212634/daylight-saving-time-car-crashes) have [previously found](https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/does-daylight-saving-time-cause-auto-accidents): the rate of car crashes on the Monday after the ‘spring-forward’ daylight event typically jumps seven to eight percent. \n\nThe shift in time also makes it more likely drivers in some parts of the country will hit deer or other wildlife, since such collisions are generally more likely at dawn and dusk, key times of the day when drivers are feeling the effects of the recent time change. \n\nOnce people get to work, daylight saving time keeps impacting them, Autolist found.\n\nJust under a third of respondents (30 percent) said they were less productive at work during the week immediately following the time change. \n\nWhat’s more, [a previous study found](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-heart-daylightsaving/daylight-saving-time-linked-to-heart-attacks-study-idUSBREA2S0D420140329) that on the Monday immediately after the start of daylight saving time (spring ahead), the rate of heart attacks was 25 percent higher. In the fall, the rate of heart attacks on the Monday after daylight saving time was 21 percent lower. \n\nMore than a quarter of respondents (27 percent) said the change in time also made them feel unsafe walking or working out outside; a third of consumers (33 percent) said they believed daylight saving time posed a danger to kids’ safety. \n\nSo what’s the solution? According to respondents, the answer may be to do away with the policy altogether. \n\nForty percent of consumers said the federal government should abolish daylight saving time outright, with 37 percent saying the government should keep it and 23 percent saying they were unsure. \n",

      "body": "### Summary  \n\nThe 2019 Dodge Grand Caravan is a minivan capable of seating up to seven passengers. While it has not had a total redesign since 2008, it has been extensively updated over the years. It competes with other minivans such as the [Honda Odyssey](https://www.autolist.com/honda-odyssey), [Toyota Sienna](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-sienna), and [Kia Sedona](https://www.autolist.com/kia-sedona), as well as the [Chrysler Pacifica](https://www.autolist.com/chrysler-pacifica).\n\nApart from a 35th Anniversary Package that incorporates special badges and adds popular features for a modest discount in honor of the Dodge Caravan's original introduction for 1984, the 2019 Grand Caravan has been mostly unchanged from last year.\n\nLarge amounts of cargo space, a powerful engine and low starting price compared to rivals have kept the Grand Caravan's sales steady in recent years. Though its design is becoming dated, its price point is attractive for value-seeking buyers, with a base price that is thousands less than other minivans.  \n\n\n### Exterior \n\nWithin the entire minivan segment, the Dodge Grand Caravan is the most traditional in its appearance. Its styling was last significantly updated in 2011, and its age shows when placed alongside more modern designs. Unlike the smoother profile even though the overall shape is the same newer [Chrysler Pacifica](https://www.autolist.com/chrysler-pacifica) and [Honda Odyssey](https://www.autolist.com/honda-odyssey), the Grand Caravan is rather boxy in its profile and looks more like an old minivan.  \n\n![2019-dodge-grand-caravan-exterior-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2hdp0G2LftHCf6VnICZqop/8f3488ba4bac380d2c658b70cc736baf/2019-dodge-grand-caravan-exterior-1.jpg)\n\nThe advantage of this, however, is that the Dodge has lots of glass area that help makes seeing out of the vehicle, especially for children, very good. The windows in the sliding side doors are power operated and slide down for more ventilation, something that has become common in minivans today.  \n\nThe rear of the Grand Caravan is simple, with squared taillights and a large, upright rear hatch. It reveals a square-shaped cargo area that makes loading large items more accessible. \n\nVarious trim packages are available depending on the trim level, while 17-inch wheels, standard on all Grand Caravan models. The gloss black wheel option helps mitigate this and gives it some needed pizazz.  \n\n![2019-dodge-grand-caravan-exterior-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5UccJusXF9OIy6aZeCYk6c/1936012c1fa827ba2efd963041014e6b/2019-dodge-grand-caravan-exterior-2.jpg)\n\nEven though reviewers generally agree that the Grand Caravan is in desperate need of a refresh, they also agree that the exterior styling of the minivan is not unattractive and further shows that functionality and practicality are prioritized over form.  \n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort \n\nThe Dodge Grand Caravan suffers in interior quality. Reviewers universally agree that the minivan's low price tag shows the most in the lack of interior quality. They note that materials are generally cheap and the technology is generally behind the times when compared to all new vehicles.  \n\n![2019-dodge-grand-caravan-interior-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6DDaqGJmBVWzZo2JJuRc6j/12197e0c531f6bb5c24df64968206526/2019-dodge-grand-caravan-interior-1.jpg)\n\nHard plastics are used throughout the interior, but there are some strategic places covered with soft-touch materials. A leather-wrapped steering wheel and available leather upholstery on higher trims give the Grand Caravan a little bit of refinement, according to testers.  \n\nOverall comfort is rated more highly by reviewers. Most note that the front seats are especially accommodating, with generous amounts of space for driver and passenger legroom. Most also note that while the front-row seats are comfortable, second-row seating comfort is higher due to the amount of legroom rather than actual seat comfort. That is because the seats themselves can feel stiff because of the design that allows them to fold. The third row is roomy, but the seating angle is odd, again because of the folding design.  \n\nBack and lumbar for the driver and front seat passenger are noted to be good. Second- and third-row seating is slightly less comfortable, according to reviewers. Testers note that headroom is satisfactory regardless of which row passengers choose.  \n\n![2019-dodge-grand-caravan-interior-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2eICc9XNYunBqQAg7fjaEi/75b5d28fdbf4a2418b92c8a205832526/2019-dodge-grand-caravan-interior-3.jpg)\n\nClimate, radio and other significant controls are easily reachable for the driver and passengers, according to most reviews.  \n\n\n### Utility & Practicality \n\nUtility and practicality are generally high, but the lack of some features on the Grand Caravan brings its score down when compared to its competition. Other minivans offer eight-passenger seating, but the Dodge is limited to no more than seven passengers. The Grand Caravan is, however, offered with the choice of a second-row bench seat or captain's chairs, capacity remains at seven passengers.  \n\n![2019-dodge-grand-caravan-interior-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7rHm1vCvYgyBsNVmrv0v3U/dbfa37a966a8061b18af915a9f8fcfd9/2019-dodge-grand-caravan-interior-2.jpg)\n\nCargo space is good with a total of just over 140 cubic feet with only the front seats in place. About 80 cubic feet is available when the third row is folded, and 31 cubic feet available with all seats in the upright positions.\n\nDodge's available Stow 'n Go seating gives the minivan some extra points as neither the second or third-row seats need to be removed from the vehicle to maximize cargo space. Instead, they fold into wells carved into the floor and create a totally flat space for objects to be easily loaded. The cargo area is vast, with an easy load height, with a tailgate that opens well out of the way. An optional power liftgate is available.  \n\n![2019-dodge-grand-caravan-exterior-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1kn927cVb427kooKMNjsto/7250dd5c3901f4ebffd1de463b21d8e9/2019-dodge-grand-caravan-exterior-3.jpg)\n\nGetting into the Grand Caravan is easy, according to reviewers. Available power-sliding rear side doors make it easy for passengers to slide into the second row, while the captain's chairs can be folded and tumbled forward to allow for better access to the third row.\n\nSmall item storage is noted to be plentiful throughout the cabin. Roof rails add the possibility of additional exterior storage.  \n\nTowing capacity is slightly better than other minivans at 3,600 pounds when properly equipped. Most other vans in the segment are rated at 3,500 pounds.  \n\n\n### Technology & Infotainment \n\nTechnology and infotainment features are two of the areas most lacking in the Grand Caravan, especially when compared to others in the segment.  \n\n![2019-dodge-grand-caravan-interior-4](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6w7l7QuZG0Apkf0YA6SMxg/73a64573e23db1b630c22582f0c4b89b/2019-dodge-grand-caravan-interior-4.jpg)\n\nApple CarPlay, Android Auto, wireless device charging, and a Wi-Fi hotspot are all missing from the list of available features. Reviewers are also unimpressed by the Uconnect infotainment system. They note that the system is very slow to respond, looks dated, and falls far behind most other systems overall – including that of newer systems on other Fiat Chrysler products such as the [Pacifica](https://www.autolist.com/chrysler-pacifica) minivan. A 6.5-inch touchscreen display is the only display size available. \n\nNotable technology features available include Bluetooth, three-zone climate controls, power-sliding rear side doors, a power liftgate, rearview camera, and a six-speaker audio system.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Safety & Driving Assistance \n\nMost of the latest driving assistance features are absent from the Dodge Grand Caravan's list of standard or available features. Rear parking sensors are the only optional safety feature the Grand Caravan has to offer. Blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and adaptive cruise control are not offered on any trim level.  \n\nOther standard safety features include traction control, electronic stability control, tire pressure monitoring system, daytime running lights, and a rearview camera. LATCH child safety seat anchors are standard on second and third-row seats.  \n\nCrash test ratings are mixed. The National Highway Safety Transportation Administration awards the Grand Caravan with an overall four-star rating out of a possible five.  \n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the Grand Caravan highly in some tests, but gave it the lowest rating of Poor in the small overlap front crash test and for the strength of its headlights, putting the vehicle behind all other minivans.   \n\n\n### Driving Experience  \n\nThe Dodge Grand Caravan is also a mixed bag when it comes to the driving experience. Minivans may not be known for providing fun behind the wheel, but reviewers find the Grand Caravan shows its age in this area, too.\n\nIt is only available with one engine option, a 3.6-liter V6 producing 283 horsepower and 260 lb.-ft. of torque, and is paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Most reviewers agree that the engine is powerful enough, but the overall powertrain shows its age. The transmission is noted to be unrefined and slightly uncertain when shifting. Acceleration is average for the class with a 0-60 mph time coming in around eight seconds, according to testers.\n\nBraking is also average among minivans with a stopping distance of 180 feet from 70 mph. Reviewers note that hard braking didn't inspire an overwhelming amount of confidence, while normal braking is handled much better. Pedal feel is indicated to be awkward at times, but under normal driving conditions, it is merely acceptable.\n\nThe Grand Caravan does much better in overall handling, according to reviewers. It is said to be surprisingly agile for how tall it is. Steering feel is noted to provide better feel than many other minivans in the segment. Reviewers note that spirited driving is hindered by lackluster hard braking feel and the placement of the shifter, which is located between the steering wheel and the infotainment screen, makes manually changing gears difficult. Most testers agree that everyday driving is accomplished enough, but is still less refined and comfortable than newer competitors.  \n\n\n### Fuel efficiency  \n\nFuel economy also lags behind others in the segment.EPA estimates of 17 mpg in the city and 25 mpg on the highway, with a combined rating of 20 mpg.  \n\nOne trick the Grand Caravan has up its sleeve is that it can run on E85 gasoline, which can produce more power, but EPA estimates of 12 miles per gallon in the city and 18 miles per gallon on the highway bring the combined fuel economy rating down to 14 miles per gallon.  \n\nThe [Kia Sedona](https://www.autolist.com/kia-sedona), the closest competitor in terms of fuel efficiency, returns 18 mpg in city driving and 24 mpg on the highway and 21 mpg combined. Apart from the [Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid](https://www.autolist.com/chrysler-pacifica), the [Honda Odyssey](https://www.autolist.com/honda-odyssey) leads the segment with a combined rating of 22 mpg. Most newer minivans have more than six speeds in the transmission or other modern fuel-saving technologies.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Pricing & Value  \n\nThe Dodge Grand Caravan presents a mixed value to its buyers, depending on their needs.  \n\nA brand new base model Grand Caravan is thousands of dollars less than other base model minivans. Space and interior versatility also presents added value. The seating configurations allows extreme versatility for both passenger and cargo space. Towing capacity is also favorable against other minivans and even some three-row SUVs. If purchase price and interior flexibility are high priorities, the Grand Caravan has a lot to offer.\n\nThe Grand Caravan will not present good value to those who desire the latest safety features, the best technology, and the best possible fuel economy for a vehicle of this size, as well as those who need eight seats in their vehicle. Fit and finish is good, but interior quality also suffers compared to the competition, according to those who have tested the minivan. Most agree that everyday driving is acceptable, but overall, driving dynamics fall behind the competition.\n\nThe Grand Caravan is starting to show its age, according to reviewers. It is beginning to suffer at the hands of newer competitors with much better standard equipment, despite its substantial sales numbers. Weak resale value and low projected reliability allow used examples of the Grand Caravan to present a very affordable option for those who need the space and a simple means of transportation.  \n\nAlmost every reviewer agrees that the best value Grand Caravan is the top-of-the-line SXT trim, even though it still falls behind the competition when it comes to modern safety and convenience technologies. Most also agree that the [Chrysler Pacifica](https://www.autolist.com/chrysler-pacifica), which is also sold at most Dodge dealerships, presents a better overall value.  \n\nWhile the [Chrysler Pacifica](https://www.autolist.com/chrysler-pacifica)'s most expensive version can eclipse $50,000, the Pacifica's lower trims offer a more refined driving experience and a better list of safety and technology features.  \n\nStandard on all Dodge Grand Caravan trims is its 3.6-liter V6 engine, six-speed automatic transmission, and front-wheel-drive. Available options on all trim levels include a Garmin navigation system, rear parking sensors, and rear DVD entertainment system with wireless headphones.  \n\n\nThe 2019 Dodge Grand Caravan minivan is available in three different trim options:  \n\n__Dodge Grand Caravan SE:__   \n\nThe base Grand Caravan SE starts at $28,285, including destination charge.  \n\nStandard features include 17-inch steel wheels, Uconnect infotainment system with a 6.5-inch touchscreen display, a six-speaker audio system, cruise control, remote keyless entry, tri-zone climate control, air conditioning, a rearview camera, second-row bench seat, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.  \n\nSecond-row captain's chairs with Stow 'n Go seating are optional, as well as the Uconnect Hands-Free Group package. It includes satellite radio, Bluetooth, a USB port, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. The 35th Anniversary Edition package includes the captain's chairs and a power driver's seat, along with special badges, piano black interior trim and red stitching on the seats.\n\n\n__Dodge Grand Caravan SE Plus:__ \n\nThe Grand Caravan SE Plus starts at $31,050.  \n\nThe SE Plus adds 17-inch alloy wheels, foglights, automatic headlights, Uconnect voice command capability, a front middle console, and the Blackout package, which adds black gloss wheels and a black grille, all in addition to the features from the base SE.  \n\nSecond-row captain's chairs remain an optional extra for an additional $1,400.  \n\n\n__Dodge Grand Caravan SXT: __\n\nThe Grand Caravan SXT is the top-of-the-line trim and starts at $33,785.  \n\nStandard features include a power-adjustable driver's seat, leather upholstery, roof rails, power-sliding side doors, second-row captain's chairs with Stow 'n Go seats, and a power liftgate.  \n\nThe Blackout package from the SE Plus is an optional extra on the SXT, as well as the Driver Convenience Group Package. That includes heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, rear window sunshades, and tri-zone automatic climate control. The SXT 35th Anniversary package adds the Driver Convenience Group contents, piano black interior trim, special badging, red stitching on the upholstery and a navigation system. \n\nWith all options equipped, a 2019 Dodge Grand Caravan SXT will top out at just over $39,000. Handicapped accessible wheelchair Grand Caravans are available to those who need them and top out at around $45,000. \n\n### More Photos\n\nSee more [2019 Dodge Grand Caravan Photos](https://www.autolist.com/dodge-grand+caravan/2019-dodge-grand-caravan-photos).",

      "body": "The difference between diesel and gas engines starts with the invention of the latter. In 1876, a man named Nikolaus August Otto invented the gas engine, which used four-stroke combustion. That is the basic idea behind modern car engines. At that point, the gasoline engine wasn't all that efficient. Only 10 percent of the fuel was being used to move the vehicle. The rest was merely producing heat.\n\n### Enter Rudolf Diesel\n\nTwo years later, in 1878, a man named Rudolf Diesel was in the era's equivalent of an engineering school called Polytechnic High School. He learned there about the poor efficiency of gas engines and resolved to come up with something more efficient. He eventually invented and patented the diesel engine in 1892. At that point, however, it was simply called the combustion power engine. Because of how efficient diesel engines are, they are often found on large pieces of equipment, like semis and container ships. However, the association with loud, big engines has made them less attractive to the average American driver. On the other hand, they are quite common in passenger vehicles in Europe.\n\n### Gasoline Engines Versus Diesel Engines\n\nIn a basic sense, both of these engines are very similar. They both use internal combustion to convert fuel into mechanical energy to move a vehicle. The fuel is converted through a rapid series of explosions within the engine. The primary difference between a gasoline engine and a diesel engine is the method by which these explosions occur. For example, in a gas engine, the fuel combines with air, which is compressed by pistons and given ignition from the sparks created by the spark plugs. However, in a diesel engine, the air gets compressed first, which makes it hot. When the fuel is injected next, it ignites from the hot air.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Four-Stroke Combustion In A Diesel Engine\n\nA diesel engine uses the same combustion cycle as a gasoline engine. However, the stroke cycle is technically different since the diesel engine does not have spark plugs. Instead, it sucks in air and then compresses it. The fuel is directly injected into the combustion chamber where it ignites from the heated air. \n\n__Take a look at the four strokes:__\n\n1. The intake stroke lets in air through the intake valve and moves the piston down.\n\n2. The compression stroke moves the piston back up while compressing the air.\n\n3. The combustion stroke injects fuel right when the piston reaches the top. The fuel ignites, and the piston is forced back down.\n\n4. The exhaust stroke moves the piston back to the top where the combustion exhaust is then pushed out through the exhaust valve.\n\n### Compression Ratio\n\nRudolf Diesel turned out to be correct that a higher compression ratio would yield higher fuel efficiency and more power. That occurs due to the concentrated air that results from the piston compressing the air inside the cylinder. The higher energy content in diesel fuel makes it more likely to react with the compressed air. In other words, the air molecules are so concentrated the fuel can respond with as many of them as possible. Rudolf's theory was correct because gasoline engines have a compression ratio between 8:1 to 12:1, while diesel engines have ratios between 14:1 to 25:1. That's twice as efficient in some cases.\n\n### The Injection Process Of Gas Engines\n\nAnother significant difference between diesel engines and gas engines is the process of fuel injection. There are two main types of injection in port injection or a carburetor. The port injection system works by injecting fuel right before the intake stroke, while a carburetor mixes both fuel and air well before the air gets into the cylinder. That means that fuel is injected into the cylinder before the intake stroke and then it's compressed. That limits the engine's compression ratio. Too much compression of the air causes spontaneous ignition, which results in knocking. This knocking is not good for the engine and may damage it eventually.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Diesel Engine Direct Injection\n\nDiesel engines have the fuel directly injected into the cylinder. As this is a vital part of how diesel engines work, the diesel injectors are quite complicated. To deliver a fine mist of fuel, they must be able to resist the high temperature and pressure inside the cylinder. Making this system more efficient has yielded a lot of experimentation in diesel engineering. \n\n__Some ways to aid this process include the following:__\n\n- Special induction valve\n\n- Glow plugs\n\n- Pre-combustion chambers\n\nFor example, the glow plug is a hot wire that quickly raises the temperature of the air in a cold engine to allow it to start more efficiently. Modern diesel vehicles have an ECM (engine control module) that communicates with an array of sensors to correctly time injection for the engine to start when cold.\n\n### Diesel Fuel Versus Gasoline Fuel\n\nBoth diesel and gasoline start out the same way, which is in the form of crude oil mined from the earth. Once it's processed and refined, it can be separated into various types of fuels. Diesel fuel is more substantial than gas and thus evaporates more slowly. It also has more energy density. These features, combined with the overall efficiency of the diesel engine, helps explain why the fuel economy is typically better than gas engines. As a passenger car driver, you might not realize just how many vehicles use diesel fuel. Aside from semi trucks, school buses, trains, construction equipment, emergency vehicles and power generators all use diesel engines.\n\n### Is Diesel Clean?\n\nThat has been a big con of diesel for a long time. It's heavy and oily and creates soot. However, in the last 40 years or so, significant improvements have been made to the cleanliness of diesel. The fuel is refined better, and computer monitoring within the engine helps reduce emissions. Soot has been reduced by catalytic converters and CRT particulate filters, which burn the residue. As recent emissions scandals have shown, however, diesel engines still have a harder time meeting emissions standards than gasoline engines.\n\nA recent trend has been the use of biodiesel, a fuel that comes from plant oil or animal fat and has been chemically altered. Conversions for older diesel models were common. However, newer diesel models are sometimes unsuitable for biodiesel retrofits.",

      "body": "The 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EV is an all-electric subcompact car that is aimed at budget and environment-conscious new car buyers. It competes with the [Hyundai Ioniq Electric](https://www.autolist.com/hyundai-ioniq+electric), [Kia Niro](https://www.autolist.com/kia-niro) EV and [Tesla Model 3](https://www.autolist.com/tesla-model+3). \n\nThe Bolt EV is now in its third model year, first going on sale for 2017. It has been slightly updated for 2019 to include new charging features, a Low Driving Mode, new interior technology features and new colors.\n\nThe Bolt EV is one of two alternative fuel vehicles that Chevrolet offers, joining the Volt. The Volt is a plug-in vehicle that uses a small gasoline engine to supplement the electric motor. The Bolt EV has a 238-mile driving range on a single charge, one of the longest driving ranges offered on any electric vehicle available for purchase today. The [Tesla Model 3](https://www.autolist.com/tesla-model+3) Long Range has a more extended, 325-mile range, but most others in the segment run between 125 and 250 miles on a single charge.\n\nThe Bolt EV is offered in two trims: LT and Premier and has a starting price of $37,495 before destination fee and options. Federal, state and local incentives may lower that price further, depending on where you live.\n\n### Pros/Cons\n\n__Pros__\n238 miles of all-electric range\nSpacious, usable interior\nFun yet comfortable ride\n\n__Cons__\nSomewhat low-rent interior materials\nHigh starting price\nAdvanced safety equipment costs extra\n\n### Exterior\n\nTL;DR The Chevy Bolt EV's exterior is most like that of a conservative hatchback's, but the available color options venture into outlandish shades.\n\n![2019-chevy-bolt-ev-exterior-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5j8o8LOsxxlgtsaA3Tx4I2/7b6fbdb27426184a29932944913eedc4/2019-chevy-bolt-ev-exterior-1.jpg)\n\nThe Bolt EV is a small hatchback with four doors, and as such, the design is somewhat conservative. Its front end is accented by LED running lights and a closed-off grille that features a prominent Chevrolet logo. Body lines rise gently from front to back, and the rear is clean and uncluttered. The car comes standard with 17-inch wheels, body-colored door handles, HID headlights and LED taillights.\n\n![2019-chevy-bolt-ev-exterior-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/42pnZnlAfjURnlmnVGol0D/ad5fb1f12a12220adb48c94f3fb9fdca/2019-chevy-bolt-ev-exterior-3.jpg)\n\nCritics praise the Bolt EV's straightforward design, but with new color names like Green Mist, Slate Gray and Shock (yellow), some of the color choices border on the outlandish.\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Chevrolet Bolt EV Interior\n\nTL;DR The Bolt EV's interior is spacious and comfortable, but the quality of the materials falls well short of what a vehicle that costs nearly $40,000 should have.\n\n![2019-chevy-bolt-ev-interior-1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/52geirdrUJfLKQ06jfLfuA/22a4b64097c9eb6e6695d565c39d2e8f/2019-chevy-bolt-ev-interior-1.jpg)\n\nThe Bolt EV is considered to be a comfortable subcompact car that can seat up to five people. Critics praise the Bolt EV for having good head- and legroom, with enough space for two adults in the rear seats without much issue. The front seats are wide enough and supportive for longer trips, but the reviewers note that the seat cushions can feel a little flat over time.\n\nBuyers with children may find difficulty installing car seats in the rear of the Bolt EV, as it was rated as \"Marginal\" for LATCH ease of use by the IIHS for having anchors that are set too deeply into the seats. Additionally, reviewers note that the Bolt EV's somewhat small rear seat may make it harder to load and unload children in the car seats.\n\n![2019-chevy-bolt-ev-interior-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2KZSPcs23DbPF8RaQl7Rbu/496fcae8aaec5b5de3d6ba853aed6fb0/2019-chevy-bolt-ev-interior-2.jpg)\n\nMaterials quality scored just OK among critics, especially for the car's relatively high price point. Chevrolet's generous use of hard plastics and budget materials throughout the cabin cheapened the feel of the vehicle, but reviewers do state that the interior is clean and modern.\n\nMany reviewers praise controls as being easy to use and clearly labeled, however. The 10.2-inch touchscreen is easy to use, colorful and bright. Many climate and vehicle controls can be used with both on-screen controls and physical buttons below the screen. The Chevrolet MyLink infotainment system provides information on charging and driving habits to improve range.\n\nCritics found that the Bolt EV is nearly as practical as a small crossover and that interior storage spaces are plentiful. The front doors have large pocket storage areas, and the center console is deep enough to be useful for medium-sized items like wallets and paperwork. The cupholders, while generously sized, are placed in an awkward location under the infotainment screen that may make them difficult to access for shorter drivers and people with larger travel cups. Even so, there can be up to six cupholders in the Bolt EV: two in the front, two in each rear door, and two in the rear armrest on Premier models.\n\n### Utility & Practicality\n\nTL;DR The Bolt EV is spacious and usable but falls short of the competition. \n\n![2019-chevy-bolt-ev-exterior-2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3U4XHosxKOpCoWjkLcp7HD/2d76cc87f6019b17bab59b7d525bb82d/2019-chevy-bolt-ev-exterior-2.jpg)\n\nThe Bolt EV is considered to be a practical subcompact car with plenty of usable space. The rear cargo area has 16.9 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats, which is suitable for such a small vehicle but is outdone by others like the Toyota Prius Prime and Volkswagen e-Golf. The rear seats fold down in a 60/40 split, which increases cargo space to up to 56.6 cubic feet. \n\nCritics like that the Bolt EV's upright design allows for generous cargo spaces, even with the rear seats are up. Reviewers found that area is large enough to carry five carry-on bags since they can be stacked behind the seats. The Bolt EV was also awarded points for its small item storage. Critics praise the car for its ability to conveniently handle items like smartphones, with a cubby just behind the cupholders perfectly sized for most devices.\n\n![2019-chevy-bolt-ev-interior-3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/KAsvfpM4R38XKU8wyx97O/3aea55e1dbd268868b835e769338f0f5/2019-chevy-bolt-ev-interior-3.jpg)\n\nThe Bolt EV comes standard with a cargo cover for the rear storage area and can be equipped with a cargo net for additional storage options. An adjustable cargo floor is also available, which allows for extra small item storage under the rear floor.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Infotainment and Technology\n\nTL;DR Technology is a strong suit for the Bolt EV. The car's information systems provide useful stats on driving, efficiency, and vehicle performance.\n\nThe Bolt EV has many standard technology features that either supplement the electric driving modes or provide entertainment and vehicle information. All models come standard with a 10.2-inch touchscreen, OnStar telematics, a 4G LTE WiFi hotspot, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, six speakers, two USB ports and SiriusXM satellite radio. \n\n![2019-chevy-bolt-ev-interior-4](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/9ClY8uRuqqpJMWqdzuOyp/c9a59fa3fe58c1551afa27d20c73bd0c/2019-chevy-bolt-ev-interior-4.jpg)\n\nOptional features include an Infotainment Package for the Premier trim, which consists of a Bose Premium seven-speaker audio system, wireless device charging and two additional USB charging ports for rear-seat passengers. Universal tablet holders are also available for rear seat entertainment and wireless smartphone charging is also available for the Premier trim.\n\nReviewers like the Chevrolet MyLink infotainment system's colorful interface. The Bolt EV's screen is located in an easy-to-reach place on the dash and provides useful information on driving and vehicle status.\n\n### Safety\n\nTL;DR The Bolt EV can be equipped with a long list of advanced safety equipment, but none come standard.\n\nThe Bolt EV is considered to be a relatively safe vehicle. Standard safety features include a Teen Driver Mode that allows parents to set limits on what their children can do in the car (in terms of driving speed and radio volume, at least), a rearview camera, an engine immobilizer, 10 airbags, LED daytime running lights, OnStar Connected Services, a pedestrian safety signal and stability control.\n\nAvailable safety features include low speed forward automatic braking, forward collision alerts, lane keep assist with lane departure warnings, front pedestrian braking, a following distance indicator, automatic high beam headlights, rear park assist, rear cross-traffic alerts, and lane change alerts with blind spot monitors. \n\nThe Bolt EV did not earn a Top Safety Pick designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but the agency did rate the car \"Good\" for front, side and roof crashworthiness. Front crash prevention was rated as \"Superior\" with optional equipment on board. The Bolt EV's headlights were rated as \"Poor,\" however, and the LATCH system ease of use was rated as \"Marginal.\"\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration awarded the maximum 5 stars to the Bolt EV with no other safety concerns noted.\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nTL;DR The Bolt EV has an engaging driving experience with good handling, snappy acceleration and a comfortable ride.\n\nThe Bolt EV's all-electric powertrain delivers torque on demand and immediate acceleration off the line. Reviewers like the lively acceleration and fun steering-wheel paddles that adjust braking and power regeneration settings.\n\nThe electric motor produces 200 horsepower and up to 266 lb.-ft. of torque and gets power from a 60-kWh lithium-ion battery pack and a single-speed transmission. Though it is out-paced by more expensive electric vehicles like the [Tesla Model 3](https://www.autolist.com/tesla-model+3) Performance, the Bolt EV's 0-60 mph acceleration time of 6.5 seconds is considered by critics to be impressive for such a small car.\n\nCritics praise the Bolt EV for a firm-but-comfortable ride that makes for an engaging and relatively fun driving experience. The battery pack's location low in the vehicle makes the center of gravity lower and improves handling. Reviewers note that the Bolt EV has responsive steering and smooth brakes that are strong and predictable. Some reviewers note that the ride can become busy on very rough roads, requiring management from the driver, but that the car never feels unpredictable or uncomfortable.\n\nThe Bolt EV comes with two driving modes: Drive and Low. Drive Mode operates like a typical vehicle, but Low Mode increases the aggressiveness of the regenerative braking, which allows for one-pedal driving in most circumstances so that you rarely need to tap the brake unless in emergencies. The car applies braking force once the driver's foot is off the gas pedal to recharge the battery and slow the vehicle. The Regen on Demand feature allows the level of braking to be set by using paddles attached to the steering wheel. It will enable the driver to avoid using the brake pedal in many slow-speed driving conditions.\n\nReviewers note that the Bolt EV's high driving position provides excellent outward visibility, similar to that in a small crossover or SUV. The car's small pillars allow for good views in nearly all directions, and its overall small size makes city driving and parking much more manageable.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Fuel Efficiency\n\nTL;DR The Bolt EV's 238-mile range puts it well ahead of most of its competition.\n\nThe Bolt EV is all-electric and uses no fuel. The Bolt EV is rated 128 MPGe in the city and 110 MPGe on the highway. MPGe means miles per gallon equivalent and measures an alternative fuel vehicle's energy consumption against gas-power vehicles.\n\nThe Bolt EV has a total estimated driving range of 238 miles on a full charge. That is better than the [Hyundai Ioniq Electric](https://www.autolist.com/hyundai-ioniq+electric) and the [Nissan Leaf](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-leaf) Plus but falls short of some Tesla models that reach 300 miles on a charge. It's also behind the 258-mile range from the similarly priced [Hyundai Kona](https://www.autolist.com/hyundai-kona) Electric.\n\nWith a 240-volt charger, recharging takes over nine hours, but DC fast charging can provide 90 miles of range in half an hour. Critics note that outside temperatures can affect the car's speed and ability to charge. They also found that the driving range indicator located in the vehicle's gauge cluster is exceptionally accurate and updates in real time as the vehicle moves.\n\n### Trim Levels and Pricing\n\nTL;DR The Bolt EV comes in two trims, but the base LT model has a long list of standard features.\n\nThe __Bolt EV LT__ has a starting price of $37,495 before destination charges and taxes and comes standard with Regen on Demand, SiriusXM Radio, Teen Driver mode, keyless push-button start, a six-speaker audio system, manual front seats, a vehicle efficiency display, a cargo cover, cargo storage for the charging cable, a 10.2-inch infotainment screen, cruise control, LED interior lighting, a leather-trimmed shift knob, location-based charging, power windows/door locks, a rearview camera, folding rear seats, remote start, automatic climate controls, a 4G LTE hotspot, and two USB ports.\n\nThe __Bolt EV Premier__ has a starting price of $41,895 before destination charges and taxes and comes with a leather-wrapped steering wheel, an automatic heated steering wheel, a false rear cargo floor, heated front seats, lane change alerts with blind spot monitors, a rear camera mirror, rear cross-traffic alerts, rear park assist, and a surround-view camera.\n\n### Value\n\nThe Bolt EV is considered to be a good value that has generous features for the price.\n\nIn its base LT trim, critics praise the Bolt EV for having a long list of standard features that significantly increase the car's value. The nearly-$40,000 price tag is not considered to be notably budget-friendly, but for an all-electric vehicle with a 238-mile driving range, the price is reasonable. And there are also incentives that can lower the initial cost significantly if buying new.\n\nMost of the competition falls short in range, except the Tesla Model 3 Extended Range, which costs considerably more. The [Nissan Leaf](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-leaf), [Hyundai Ioniq Electric](https://www.autolist.com/hyundai-ioniq+electric), and [Volkswagen e-Golf](https://www.autolist.com/volkswagen-e+golf) all have shorter driving ranges.\n\n### More Photos\n\nSee more [2019 Chevy Bolt EV Photos](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-bolt+ev/2019-chevy-bolt-ev-photos).",

      "body": "One of the least-liked and probably most frustrating parts about buying a used or new car is having to negotiate the deal. When car dealers advertise no-haggle pricing, it often looks desirable to car shoppers. The question is, what exactly is a no-haggle price, and is it actually \"no-haggle?\"\n\n### What Are No-Haggle Car Prices?\n\nOn the surface, the point of a no-haggle price is to give you an exact price on a car that you either pay or don't. It's like walking into a retail store and seeing a TV for $500. You either buy it or look somewhere else for a lower price. Many people feel that car buying should also be this simple. A firm price enables people to shop easily for a car as they would shop for anything else. If the car price doesn't fit their budget, they can move onto a different vehicle or dealer.\n\n### Who Offers No-Haggle Prices?\n\nSometimes car dealers advertise specific cars with a no-haggle price, other times the dealer exclusively does business like this. Membership warehouse stores like Costco and Sam's Club often offer no-haggle price programs, as do organizations like the AAA or even some credit unions. Dealer chains like CarMax are also well-known for advertising their no-haggle prices. At CarMax in particular, the salespeople are paid a guaranteed wage no matter which vehicle they sell. In other words, they don't get a commission based entirely on selling a vehicle for more money. Dealerships who use this pricing model typically get customer attention through decrying the usual haggling model of car buying. It tends to work as many people hate negotiating on new or used cars.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### No Bait-And Switch\n\nOne very tangible benefit of no-haggle pricing is avoiding the common dealer tactic of bait-and-switch. This tactic mainly works by baiting buyers to come in with an advertised low price on a specific vehicle. The vehicle advertised is usually a basic model with no options, so naturally, the low price looks attractive. When you come in, you'll find that you have to spend a lot more to get options or higher trims. Another way this works is to advertise a vehicle at a low price, but then that vehicle is gone when someone comes in to see it. In a no-haggle program, an advertised price is tied to a stock number or VIN on the quote. If you come in and say that you want the red Toyota Camry with a navigation system, then that's the vehicle you'll see. If the vehicle is gone, then it's often possible to get it ordered for the price advertised.\n\n### Why Do Dealers Go With No-Haggle?\n\nMany dealers who do this say that it's just less hassle and that it improves the buying experience for customers. They know that car buyers are going to use all the various online tools to find out exactly what a vehicle is worth in their area. Their attitude is that if a buyer knows what they want to pay and what the car is worth, what's the point of starting negotiations at $4,000 over on the off-chance that you might get it? In other words, some dealers and salespeople are just as tired of long haggling experiences as car buyers are.\n\n### Some Car Shoppers Like To Haggle\n\nOn the other hand, there are car buyers who really want to haggle with the dealer to get the lowest possible price. They believe that they can go into it and get a better deal than taking the no-haggle price. However, in some cases, these buyers may spend hours negotiating to end up with less than $1,000 off the price. \n\n### Can Dealers Falsely Advertise No-Haggle?\n\nGenerally speaking, any dealer that advertises no-haggle pricing usually sticks with it. The reason for this is twofold. If they publicize no-haggle pricing but start negotiating later, they aren't advertising truthfully. False advertising is illegal and could result in penalties if the dealer is caught. And if they haggle, word about that will eventually spread. If a buyer who didn't haggle a price finds out that another shopper was able to reduce the cost by haggling, they're likely to become angry and report the dealer through review sites or the Better Business Bureau. Further, other shoppers are expected to come in and haggle, which would render the dealer's advertisement of no-haggle prices pretty much worthless. Most dealers who identify as no-haggle also have policies against haggling, so if you hear from someone that they haggled at a no-haggle dealer, it's usually best to be a little suspicious of it.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Is No-Haggle Really Better?\n\nUltimately, the question comes down to whether buying from a no-haggle dealership will get you the best price or not. If the price on the car is much more than what you could potentially get from a traditional dealer, then it's probably better to skip it. However, it's also true that some car shoppers are willing to pay a higher price to simplify the car buying process. On the other hand, if you're a car shopper on a budget, it's probably not worth it to you to pay several thousand more for a vehicle that you could potentially pay a lot less for at a traditional dealer. If the price at a no-haggle dealer is only some hundreds over that of a traditional dealer, then it probably is worth it to many car shoppers.\n\n### Used and New No-Haggle Experience\n\nAnother area where the no-haggle experience can vary is with a used vehicle versus a new one. For example, one customer detailed his experience in shopping for a new car where he asked for the best deal from both a no-haggle dealership and a traditional one. The former offered $600 off the MSRP while the latter offered $1,800 off. When he tried to get the no-haggle dealership to meet it, they insisted it was their best price. The problem was, it was precisely the same new car. However, used cars can be a different experience altogether. The reason is that it's not as easy to find two used cars that are the same in your area. In another example, the customer finds two used vehicles of the same year and model. One is a non-certified used vehicle with 28,000 miles, and the other is a Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) vehicle with 27,000 miles. The dealership with the CPO car is a no-haggle dealership and has it priced at $29,500. The dealership with the non-CPO car has it priced at $28,700 and is willing to go down to $28,000. Even though the CPO car is $1,500 more, it's also being sold by a branded dealership and has a factory-backed extended warranty attached to it. That, and the 1,000 fewer miles on it adds value and, in effect, makes it the better deal.\n\nIn the end, whether dealers who promote no-haggle prices are better depends mostly on your situation. If you can find a lower price and more value at a traditional dealership, then you might skip the no-haggle experience. However, if haggling is your worst nightmare when it comes to buying a car, then you might be willing to pay a higher sale price to skip that part.",

      "body": "Autolist rating: __4/5__\nBut would we buy it? __Gladly__\nPrice range: __$27,655 - $42,980__, including destination but before options\n\n---\n\n## Key takeaways:\n\n- All-new sixth generation debuts for the 2020 model year. \n- All-wheel-drive, spaciousness and safety remain some of the Outback’s hallmarks. \n- An optional new turbocharged four-cylinder replaces the outgoing six-cylinder engine.\n- The base model, in particular, needs more power, and this generation isn’t particularly thrilling. \n- A new platform means impressive levels of refinement on and off-road. \n\n---\n \n## What is it?\n\nThe Subaru Outback is a midsize family station-wagon-meets-SUV currently in its sixth generation. The Outback is based on Subaru’s Legacy family sedan; it was completely redesigned for the 2020 model year. It’s larger than Subaru’s Crosstrek hatchback and Impreza sedan and hatchback but smaller than the brand’s Ascent three-row crossover and similar in price to Subaru’s Forester crossover. \n\n![2020 Outback 17](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4i0wg75mayLPF83DRzNHwC/99018862a3e486190d8dbbe885064a65/2020_Outback_17.jpg) \n\nThe 2020 Outback comes with one of two engines. Base models get a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 182 horsepower and 176 pound-feet of torque. This engine is paired with a continuously-variable transmission (CVT) and full-time all-wheel-drive. \n\nHigher-trim Outbacks are also available with Subaru’s 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that makes 260 horsepower and 277 pound-feet of torque. Like the non-turbo base engine, this turbo unit is paired with a CVT and full-time AWD. This engine replaces the optional six-cylinder unit that was offered on earlier generations of the Outback. \n\nThe Outback comes in four trims for the base engine (Outback, Premium, Limited, and Touring) and three with the turbo engine (Onyx Edition XT, Limited XT, and Touring XT). \n\nThis new generation rides on an all-new platform that underpins nearly every current Subaru on the market. This makes the new Outback quieter, stiffer, and more spacious; rear legroom is up 1.4 inches, as is the Outback’s overall length when compared to the previous generation. \n\nThe other big news for this new sixth-generation version is the massive 11.6-inch touchscreen in the center of the dash, a feature that’s standard on all models save for the base Outback. \n \n---\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n\n## What’s good?\n\n*TLDR: Roomy, safe and packing a big touchscreen.*\n\n![20TDI OBKpl006](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4a2VVjLZEDb2jalrM8EFeg/d43bc477156b3b02bf45c84933ed8b40/20TDI_OBKpl006.jpg) \n\n__Spacious__ SUVs are all the rage, but don’t forget just how much room a wagon like the Subaru Outback offers. Subaru stretched the car’s length 1.4 inches over the previous version, and all of that went into rear legroom, which is generous even for tall passengers. The cargo area is a little larger than it was before. During our week of testing, we used this Outback to help a friend move; with the rear seats folded flat, it was remarkable just how much stuff we were able to, um, stuff in the back. Though it’s not technically an SUV, there’s plenty of ‘U’ in this Outback. \n\n__Safe__ Subaru has recently been equipping its vehicles with an impressive list of standard safety gear for which other brands charge big bucks. This new Outback continues that trend. All models come standard with adaptive cruise control with lane centering, pre-collision braking, lane departure and sway warning, and lane-keep assist. Higher-trim models add blind-spot monitoring, lane-change assist and rear cross-traffic alerts, and the top Touring trim adds a facial-recognition setup that will monitor and alert the driver for distracted or drowsy driving, plus adjust the vehicle’s setting automatically based on who’s sitting in the seat. \n\n __Touchscreen__ We test hundreds of cars a year, so believe us when we say that not all touchscreens are created equal. Subaru’s new unit -- standard on all models save for the base Outback -- is a winner. It’s huge (11.6-inches), responsive, and intuitive. Plus, Subaru has built-in hard buttons for knobs or the right features (temperature, volume, and tuning), so you’re never left fiddling with a hard-to-find digital button.\n \n![20TDI OBKpl029](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1ZF4GwFLbyEWVMEaS68IOp/b012c5a48a9f5982c587bcaed933d7f0/20TDI_OBKpl029.jpg)\n\n\n---\n\n## What’s bad?\n*TLDR: Tepid styling, down on power, not a great value.*\n\n__Is that the new one?__ Even though Subaru claims its (very loyal) Outback customers didn’t want to see a meaningful design change, the company could have done a little more updating. Yes, the interior is entirely new and refreshing, but the exterior -- even to savvy Outback spotters -- is too much like the older model it’s replacing. This is a bummer for buyers who want to show off their new vehicle -- since it looks like the same model that’s been cruising around for years. \n\n![2020 Outback 38](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/102SmRkAvpz7X8wAizc1kE/eda90abd0ce9b860303d3a40469e5450/2020_Outback_38.jpg) \n\n__Lacks grunt__ The Outback needs more power. The base model -- the one Subaru will sell the most of -- has just 182 horsepower, which isn’t enough for the car. Its acceleration is tepid both from a stop and in passing situations or on-ramps, and this lack of power then causes the CVT to drone loudly when pushing the car. The optional turbo engine and its 260 horsepower is definitely an improvement, but even it doesn’t really give you the ‘yes please’ assertiveness we’d like. \n\n__No more value play__ We tested an Outback Premium with the base engine and an options package that added goodies like a moonroof, power rear liftgate, keyless access, push-button start, and a navigation system. The total came to $33,000, which didn’t seem like a particularly good value. This was the specification we’d probably choose if we were buying the car ourselves, but nothing in it felt particularly worthy of the $33,000 price tag. \n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n\n## 5 stars of execution\n\nSafety Features? __YES__\n- Subaru is currently doing an excellent job of packing its vehicles full of standard, active safety tech. \n- This Outback is no different, offering its EyeSight suite of safety gear as standard on all models. \n- This suite includes adaptive cruise control with lane centering, pre-collision braking, lane departure and sway warning, and lane-keep assist.\n\n\nValue? __NO__\n- As we mentioned, we weren’t particularly impressed with the Outback’s value quotient.\n- The car starts at $27,655, which seems a little high. \n- Our tester had the base engine plus a few goodies, but its $33,000 sticker price still seemed too high. \n- The top-end turbo Touring model will run you more than $40,000.\n- For that money, we’d hope for additional refinement or luxury touches, particularly in the exterior styling department. \n\nEfficiency? __YES__\n- The EPA rated the Outback at 26/33/29 city/highway/combined for the base engine. \n- Those fuel economy figures are each one MPG higher than the previous generation, despite the car growing longer and more capable. \n- Those are respectable numbers given the size of this Outback and the fact that it’s AWD. \n\n![2020 Outback 32](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7M9HkhqTP9o5v3pJIupMJ7/7a1e2d2d4d05649789645c42e30b552b/2020_Outback_32.jpg) \n\nDriving experience? __YES__ \n- Throughout our testing, we were won over by the level of quiet refinement this generation of Outback offers. \n- The engine, ride quality, and noise levels are all impressive, especially given the Outback’s rugged outward demeanor. \n- Yes, the Outback -- especially the base engine -- feels underpowered but not to the point where you should avoid the car because of it. \n\n\nExecution? __YES__\n- Overall, Subaru did an excellent job of keeping the Outback true to form. \n- It’s practical, comfortable, rugged, and safe, and it will make existing Outback owners very happy. \n- The added space and newfound refinement are also welcome additions to this generation. \n- We just wish higher-end trims had more sophisticated exterior styling and that both the base engine and the optional turbo had more grunt. \n\n## Total Rating: 4 stars\n \n--- \n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\nThe __base__ non-turbo Outback (creatively called the Outback) starts at $27,655, including destination. Standard equipment includes all-wheel-drive, 17-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights, the aforementioned EyeSight suite of safety tech, two seven-inch touchscreens for the infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, electronic parking brake and rear seats split 60/40 that fold flat. \n\nThe __Premium__ model starts at $29,905 and adds things like the 11.6-inch dashboard touchscreen, a 10-way power driver’s seat, heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, LED fog lights, 18-inch alloy wheels, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. \n\nThe __Limited__ starts at $34,455 (including destination) and adds leather seats, a power liftgate, different 18-inch alloy wheels, a power front passenger seat, driver’s seat memory, heated rear seats, and a Harman Kardon premium audio system. \n\n\n![11. 2020 Outback](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4Vdd7JhcuIlEk9k7cLJaPH/2e641d6adc28632e59c55dc670527702/11._2020_Outback.jpg) \n\nThe __Touring__ starts at $38,355 and is the highest-end trim level without the turbo engine. This model adds features like a power moonroof, power-folding satin chrome-finished side mirror caps, ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, Nappa leather seats, the DriverFocus driver monitoring system, and a navigation system built into the infotainment system. \n\nThe Outback turbo models start with the $35,905 __Onyx Edition XT__. This model has all of the kit of the base Outback Limited plus the 260-horsepower turbo engine, unique black 18-inch alloy wheels, unique exterior trim, and something called StarTex water-repellant seat fabric.\n\nThe __Limited XT__ starts at $38,755 and adds leather seats, a moonroof, steering-responsive headlights, heated steering wheel, the DriverFocus driver monitoring system, and navigation. \n\nFinally, the top-end __Touring XT__ starts at $40,705 and includes goodies like ventilated front seats and Nappa leather upholstery.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, if it were our pick, we’d probably opt for the Premium model and be done with it. This gives you all of the things that make the Outback great without adding fluff that gets expensive.  \n\n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n ## Also consider:\n\nSince the Outback is technically a station wagon -- but a rugged one at that -- there’s little direct competition. \n\n__Audi’s allroad__ is similar to the Outback in terms of approach, but it’s much more expensive (they start at about $46,000). There’s also the __Volvo V60 XC wagon__ -- it too starts at about $46,000 and packs plenty of rugged refinement. \n\nIf you act quickly, you might be able to snatch up one of the last __Volkswagen Golf Alltracks__. These excellent Golf-based wagons pack a bit of extra ground clearance, European refinement and styling, and great driving dynamics. Unfortunately, VW is discontinuing the Alltrack after 2019 due to poor sales and because it wants people buying more of its SUVs. \n\nThere’s also the __Buick Regal TourX__, a European-derived wagon that packs a little off-street cred. \n\nOtherwise, the Outback competes with a wide range of crossovers and SUVs, which includes the __Honda Passport__ and __CR-V, Ford Edge__, Subaru’s own __Forester__, the __Nissan Murano__, the __Jeep Grand Cherokee__, __Chevy Blazer__, and __Traverse__, __Hyundai Santa Fe__, the __Kia Sorento__, and the __Toyota RAV4__ and __4Runner__.\n\n\n",

      "body": "Perhaps no component on a vehicle has more importance than its headlights. After all, lights are crucial to safety on the road. They ensure that you can see the road ahead, even at night or during low-light situations. And they also ensure that others see your vehicle. \n\nHeadlight technology has significantly evolved since automobiles started to appear close to the start of the 20th century. These early cars were predominantly equipped with simplistic acetylene lamps. Those headlamps overcame the challenges of carriage lamps, which powered by candlelight because they were resistant to rain and wind. The Electric Vehicle Company of Hartford introduced the first electric headlamps in 1898, but they were limited in mainstream use due to the short lifespan of the filaments incorporated in their design.\n\nThe origins of today's headlight system didn't come about until 1912 when Delco's electrical lighting and ignition system was put to use in the 1912 Cadillac. A half-century and several technological leaps later (including electromagnetically shifted reflectors and steering-linked lighting), we arrived at the halogen lamp in 1962. They were first used only in Europe but became street-legal in the U.S. beginning in 1978.  \n\nNow, other technologies are supplanting the long-used halogen light, including LEDs. They may be appearing on more vehicles, and ones costing close to $20,000. But are LEDs superior to halogen headlights? In some ways, yes.\n\nAn LED light is bright, white light. By appearance, even daylight isn't as white. Does that matter? From the perspective of light return, yes. LEDs make it easier to see the shoulder and markings on the road and the signs on the road since they produce a brighter light than traditional halogen lamps.\n\nLED headlights cast a large light pattern on the roadway, so it's easier for you to get a more ample look at where you're going and what's in your surroundings. Halogen headlights, by contrast, direct a small pool of yellow-hued light that hits right in front of your vehicle.\n\nThe most significant advantage that LED lights has to offer the average driver is a considerable improvement of nighttime vision. When compared to halogen lights, the difference can be noticeable enough to make nighttime driving more comfortable.\n\nCoverage and brightness are two selling points of LED lights. If an animal is in the road around a curve, LED light tends to broadcast across a broader spectrum than halogen. That potentially gives more reaction time behind the wheel to deal with just such an occurrence and steer or brake accordingly.\n\nLEDs are also powerful. The bulbs provide full brightness with no warm-up wait required and no flickering to go straight from low beam to high beam. And it achieves this without requiring a lot of power, decreasing the burden put on electrical systems. That is becoming increasingly important as new vehicles add powerful radars and cameras.\n\nThe cost of headlights doesn't just come up in the price you'll pay at the dealer for the vehicle. If a replacement is ever needed because the LEDs are damaged or burned out over time, plan on spending more than you would for a halogen replacement. Much more, in fact. \n\nReplacement costs vary widely by the car's make and model (and the shop doing the replacement). For example, a BMW headlight assembly minus the bulb runs around $985 for a BMW, and that's before labor is factored in. It isn't unusual to see a repair bill for LED headlights run over $2,000. Some LED headlamps also have sophisticated sensors and leveling devices than standard halogen lights, adding to the cost. Consider that if your vehicle doesn't pass a state inspection one time, or if it's in a parking lot crash at one point.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Why Do Manufacturers Love LEDs?\n\nNever mind the fact that LEDs are popular in the auto industry right now. Manufacturers looking to achieve sleeker-looking, modish profiles on their models love the fact that LED lights can be small and unobtrusive. Audi, BMW, Toyota. All have come out with cars using high-quality LED headlight systems. From a design standpoint, this small size allows for more design flexibility. Automakers can create a bevy of assemblies and shapes to go well with the cars they turn out. And they virtually eliminate the less-elegant dome reflectors that are associated with halogen lamps.\n\nBut there are some drawbacks. Although LED lamps do not put out as much heat as halogen lamps, they do generate heat from their emission base, particularly in the region of the chip in the emitter. So when electricity comes through, there is some possibility of problems with connection cables and assembles, so LED lamps require their own cooling systems to prevent them from melting. For this reason, fans or heat sinks are usually part of the LED lamp setup, which is a bit of added cost for automakers. And because the cooling systems used for LED lights are situated in the hot engine bay, designing and implementing LEDs into a car is no small feat. That's why automakers pass these additional costs on to the buyer and often make LEDs an upgrade or available with particular trim packages only.\n\nIf you're just interested in having LED taillamps or running lights added to your vehicle, you're in luck. These don't require heat sinks. These lights are not relied upon for nighttime illumination, so they don't need to have as much power as headlamps. Therefore, they don't experience the level of current running through their chips that pose a heat problem on headlights.\n\n### Why Halogen Headlights Still Rule the Roads\n\nMost vehicles on the road today still have halogen bulbs in their headlights. The way they work is simple; an electrical charge hits a tungsten filament inside a heat-resistant envelope surrounded by nitrogen and argon gases. This ignition causes a glow of incandescent light from the bulb. Halogens have been around for a long time, and it's easy to see why. They are cheap, they are easy to replace, and they are pretty much universal. You can go to nearly any auto parts store and pick up a new one or order it, and they are reasonably simple to change. If you usually perform minor repairs on your vehicle, changing a halogen bulb takes just a few minutes. However, they're only rated for an average of 800 hours of use, and their extra sensitive and not so durable. They are also energy-intense, which is one reason they're not the eco-friendliest or greenest option.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### What About Xenon?\n\nWhen discussing LED headlights, it's important not to confuse them with Xenon headlights, which are a different, yet similar, animal altogether.\n\nXenon lights are also called HID (high-intensity discharge) headlights. HID lights are the brightest and whitest of all headlights on the market, providing broad illumination of the roadway ahead. HIDs are expensive, so they are geared more toward drivers who are generally out after dark frequently.\n\nOne thing that separates LED, halogen and Xenon or HID lights from one another is their color temperature. LEDs are the coolest, coming in at approximately 6,000 Kelvin, giving them their bright whiteness. Xenon bulbs are around 4,500 Kelvin, and halogens are generally in the 3,200 Kelvin range. Xenon options produce more light than LEDs and halogen lights; however, HID bulbs often have more glare than LEDs, although they provide intense light. LEDs tend to cost more than the other two options, but they offer fabulously clear light with long lamp life and low power needs.\n\n### Conversion Kits\n\nNot ready to trade your old car or truck in for a fancy new upgrade that is equipped with halogen headlights? No big. The aftermarket wizards are proud to make your acquaintance so that you can one-up your driving experience without taking the plunge and buying a new car. Conversion kits for LED headlamps can be a smart addition to your vehicle that makes for safer driving and added efficiency. Be aware, though, that not all states allow for aftermarket headlight conversions, so check first before you invest in a lighting upgrade.\n\nA knowledgeable mechanic should review your owner's manual to ensure that the fitment from the conversion kit will work with your vehicle's electrical system. And even then, a specialist is required to fit them, due to the added heat that the lights put out. It is not a job for even the most avid DIY-ers, no matter how enthusiastic. If the LED conversion kit is improperly installed or of poor quality, the result can also be dangerous for you and others on the road.\n\nAlso, consult various rules for vehicle inspections in your state. That may avoid surprises when an inspector fails your vehicle because the lights do not meet the standards depending on where you live. Again, not all aftermarket solutions are created equally, so consult the manufacturer and a professional installer before adding them to your vehicle.\n\n### Which Should You Choose?\n\nThe best way to determine if LED lights are worth the upgrade may be to assess your particular driving needs. Are you often out driving at night, or are you generally home before the sun goes down? Do you spend a lot of time driving in low-light or rainy conditions? If you don't drive a lot and seldom drive at night, then the added cost of a trim package that includes LED lights may not be worth it.\n\nLike all options and accessories, do some research and see if the option is worth the price. For buyers of pre-owned luxury cars where the technology is standard, consider asking how much the part will cost should it fail when the vehicle is out of warranty. That may save some surprises down the road.",

      "body": "Pickup trucks enjoy enduring popularity in America, and why not? They're the ultimate utility vehicle with room for cargo in the bed, towing capacity, optional off-road ability, and passenger room when you buy a crew cab model. If you want to beat the depreciation curve by looking for the best used trucks under $ 25,000, then you're making a smart move. The moment you drive a new vehicle off the dealer's lot, it begins to depreciate. Many new pickup trucks lose up to 30 percent of their value just in the first year alone.\n\nThat same depreciation on new vehicles is a boon for you when you're shopping for a used truck. While you might have room in your budget for the base model, if you catch a mid or top-level trim model a few years older, you can save as much as 50 percent from the truck's original sticker price. Let's take a look at some of the top used pickup trucks that you can find for under $25,000.\n\n### 1. Nissan Titan\n\n![nissan-titan](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1CnNxgxhB7MkaU2wS6IuZK/36881e5c4a53074f8dbc6c967137589a/nissan-titan.jpg)\n\nThe Titan is somewhat of a lesser-known model amongst the domestic brands, but it offers an alternative to those monster-sized heavy-duty trucks. If you go for the Titan XD, then you can get a reasonably recent model with good towing capacity and a diesel engine for under $25,000. However, you'll be looking at the regular cab, which can accommodate three passengers via a split front bench seat. The Titan XD with the 5.0-liter turbodiesel V8 is capable of towing up to 12,640 pounds. You can also get a 5.6-liter gas-powered V8, which makes 390 horsepower, but much less torque than the diesel at 394 versus 555. If you're looking more at a four-door, crew cab truck, then you might consider the four-wheel-drive 2011 Titan PRO-4X with a 5.6 liter V8. And if you're not looking for a 4x4 model, the 2015 Titan SV that still has a ton of desirable features like heated leather seats and a premium sound system. An average price for these older models is around $20,500.\n\n[See Nissan Titan Listings](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-titan#price_min=15000&price_max=25000&radius=500)\n\n### 2. Toyota Tundra\n\n![toyota-tundra](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6lsGv5YjrAWPzwa7UVKWW4/698c4eb3aa4d3232cc8c64be63e496b3/toyota-tundra.jpg)\n\nThe Tundra is in a lot of best-of lists when it comes to used pickup trucks. If you consider an older model like the 2015 Tundra SR5, you'll be looking at a 381-horsepower V8 and towing ability of 10,300 pounds when properly equipped. You have some options when looking at the 2015 Tundra. The SR trim level offers a fold-down front bench seat standard, which can accommodate three people. Other trims offer front bucket seats, and the double cab Tundra has rear doors for easier access to the rear seats. The Tundra features a rather sizeable 145.7-inch wheelbase, but that also means you'll get a 78.7-inch truck bed. The other big perk of the Tundra is undoubtedly the excellent Toyota reliability. The Tundra has five-star crash ratings and is recommended by Consumer Reports. An average price for this year of Tundra is around $22,000.\n\n[See Toyota Tundra Listings](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-tundra#price_min=15000&price_max=25000&radius=500)\n\n### 3. Ford F-150\n\n![ford-f-150](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/76b0EKPZgmvAgqcwUkybtI/91a553c9f047e25d832fb6852297c53b/ford-f-150.jpg)\n\nThe Ford F-150 is and has been the top-selling truck in America for a long time. It inspires an army of loyal customers who keep returning to its strong capability and reliability. Because the F-150 holds its value so well, you'll have to go back to 2013 to find well-equipped models selling under $25,000. If you look at the 2013 XLT trim, you'll get a 5.0-liter V8, Bluetooth, and two-wheel drive. If 4WD is your preference, then you'll likely need to go back a little further with a 2011 F-150 FX4, which also packs a V8, plus a sunroof and leather seats. Another option is the 2013 SuperCrew, which offers enough interior room for five adults. You'll generally have a few options for engines, including the V8 mentioned above as well as a V6 and turbocharged V6. A six-speed automatic transmission is offered across the full range of trims. An average price for models mentioned is around $21,500 or less.\n\n[See Ford F-150 Listings](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150#price_min=15000&price_max=25000&radius=500)\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### 4. Ford Ranger\n\n![ford-ranger](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2U0ACFEgUfKfwjnPbqBhEc/8f458c7d3ca44d31a432323d86de9605/ford-ranger.jpg)\n\nThe Ranger has recently been reintroduced after being out of production since 2012, which means that it's pretty easy to find older models for well under $25,000. The 2011 Ranger XL offers an average price of under $15,500 and reasonable fuel economy as its 2.3-liter engine with a five-speed manual returned figures of 27 mpg on the highway and 22 mpg in the city. Though you might run across some models with high mileage, there are plenty with low mileage under 50,000. Some features of the Ranger XL include traction control, side airbags, air conditioning, tow hitch and ABS brakes. As usual, you'll generally pay more for 4WD Rangers, but the 2WD versions tend to give you the most overall value. The 2019 Ford Ranger MSRP is as low as $24,300 to start for the XL trim, which gets you the 2.3-liter EcoBoost engine and a 10-speed automatic transmission. By the time the 2020 models come out, you'll likely be able to get this trim for even less.\n\n[See Ford Ranger Listings](https://www.autolist.com/ford-ranger#price_min=15000&price_max=25000&radius=500)\n\n### 5. Honda Ridgeline\n\n![honda-ridgeline](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3hNBicMT913kPzJMRehFDv/dd587a7716e37fe9f6aa966441cf12e5/honda-ridgeline.jpg)\n\nHonda's entry on this list may not be the most conventional pickup truck, but it has plenty of fans and is recommended by Consumer Reports. The reason it's not conventional is that it's designed with a unibody chassis like a car, whereas most trucks are built with body-on-frame construction. The four-wheel independent suspension, coupled with the unibody construction gives it an incredibly smooth ride and sharper handling. If you're looking at trucks under $25,000, you'll be looking at the 2014 Ridgeline, which offers a four-door design and seating for five passengers. The large rear doors make getting into the back seat easy and convenient. A 122-inch wheelbase makes the Ridgeline quite easy to maneuver, but also means that it only has a 60-inch truck bed. However, the bed is deep, with an 8.5 cubic-foot locking trunk underneath the bed floor. The only choice of engine here is a 3.5-liter V6, which makes 250 horsepower and allows for 5,500 pounds of towing ability. An average price for a 2014 Honda Ridgeline Sport 4WD is right around $23,100.\n\n[See Honda Ridgeline Listings](https://www.autolist.com/honda-ridgeline#price_min=15000&price_max=25000&radius=500)\n\n### 6. GMC Sierra 1500\n\n![gmc-sierra-1500](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1m79He0hvcHWmeHgcj8Dhy/69651848a4701a7f09bd8b78959ab99c/gmc-sierra-1500.jpg)\n\nThe Sierra is more or less the same truck as a Silverado, but it has a distinct look and clientele that will only buy GMC. You won't have to go back too far to find models priced under $25,000. A 2015 model will offer four-wheel-drive and a 4.3 liter V6 that produces 285 horsepower for an average price of $21,500. If you need a little more truck, you can go back to the 2014 model year to look at an extended cab 4WD for around $22,700. This model offers a V8 engine, a 143.5-inch wheelbase and 62 cubic feet of volume in the truck bed. The towing capacity for this configuration is 11,900 pounds. Although the Sierra offers three engine choices in the V6 mentioned above, plus two V8 options, if you want four-wheel drive, you'll probably be looking at the 5.3-liter engine versus the 6.2. Other features on this year of Sierra include stability control, ABS brakes, front park assist and a tire pressure monitoring system.\n\n[See GMC Sierra 1500 Listings](https://www.autolist.com/gmc-sierra+1500#price_min=15000&price_max=25000&radius=500)\n\n### 7. Toyota Tacoma\n\n![toyota-tacoma](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1R2iVkiNy8H7dvnOQp2xgy/276300086a6b2fc18ad34bd96fb974bd/toyota-tacoma.jpg)\n\nIf you're looking for a reliable midsize pickup truck, then it's hard to find something that fits the bill more than the Tacoma. You won't even have to go too far back to find one under $25,000. The 2017 Tacoma SR has an average price of around $21,000. It offers a 159 horsepower engine, a rearview camera, Bluetooth compatibility and traction control. The Tacoma comes in a lot of different configurations, but one of the most useful is undoubtedly the Crew Cab. If you look at a 2017 SR Crew Cab, you probably won't have to pay more than $24,000 as long as you get the two-wheel-drive version. A choice of two engines is available, including the four-cylinder above and a 278-horsepower V6. Six-speed automatic transmissions are standard, but a manual transmission was available until 2018. When properly equipped, the Tacoma can tow up to 6,400 pounds. Like the Tundra, you'll also get strong Toyota reliability and good crash ratings from the NHTSA and IIHS.\n\n[See Toyota Tacoma Listings](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-tacoma#price_min=15000&price_max=25000&radius=500)\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### 8. Nissan Frontier\n\n![nissan-frontier](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6xh6Rg6tdSFIYPwSnOEwCZ/7b80a71b7e990b7f00229b0d0ea8460b/nissan-frontier.jpg)\n\nAnother choice in the midsize market is the Nissan Frontier. These can easily be found under $25,000 and even under $20,000 depending on the options, trim and model year. For the lower price point, you might be looking at a two-wheel-drive 2013 Frontier SL model with heated leather seats, a 4.0-liter V6 engine making 261 horsepower, plus Bluetooth capability. For something closer to $25,000, you might be looking at the 2016 Frontier King Cab PRO-4X 4WD model. That is Nissan's dedicated off-road version of the Frontier, and it offers a luxury interior and a compact 125.9-inch wheelbase. The truck bed is on the small side at 34 cubic-feet, but it can tow up to 6,300 pounds when properly equipped. Two engines were offered on the 2016 Frontier, including the 2.5-liter four-cylinder and a 4.0-liter V6. The latter is the choice engine for the PRO-4X. Some other features on the PRO-4X include cruise control, power locks and windows, off-road shocks, skid plates, and 16-inch alloy wheels.\n\n[See Nissan Frontier Listings](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-frontier#price_min=15000&price_max=25000&radius=500)\n\n### 9. Chevrolet Silverado 1500\n\n![chevrolet-silverado-1500](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2ZjonER8sglP5EdrLGN5aT/429f89a7c0e3d8a92658ff3e8c40edaf/chevrolet-silverado-1500.jpg)\n\nThe Chevy Silverado is very similar to the Sierra, but with some different exterior styling. It's also quite an affordable entry in the full-sized truck category. Looking at the 2015 Silverado LS, you'll get a V8 engine with 355 horsepower, plus interior space for six passengers. The 2WD version can be had for under $21,500. Another version is the 2015 Extended Cab LT 2WD, which is a base trim, but still well equipped. The Extended Cab LT has a 143.5-inch wheelbase and 61 cubic feet of bed space, with a maximum towing capacity of 9,200 pounds in this configuration. Three engine choices were available in the 2015 Silverado 1500, including a 4.3-liter V6 with 285 horsepower, a 5.3-liter V8 with 355 horsepower and a 6.2-liter V8 with 420 horsepower. Most of these came with six-speed automatic transmissions. Other features in this model year of Silverado 1500 included a backup camera and 4-inch touchscreen display.\n\n[See Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Listings](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-silverado+1500#price_min=15000&price_max=25000&radius=500)\n\n### 10. Ram 1500\n\n![ram-1500](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3l6XO1qi2w8qGfbE9tezuM/93500e229e833657dcc9e3f8f79e8012/ram-1500.jpg)\n\nThe Ram 1500 is a top-selling pickup in many markets for good reasons, as it offers a lot of options and you don't have to go too far back in history to get one under $25,000. Take a look at the 2015 Ram 1500 Crew Cab SLT 2WD for a price point just under $25,000. This hefty truck can fit six people in its four-door cabin, and it has plenty of niceties like air conditioning, keyless entry and cruise control. A wide range of engine choices was available for the 2015 Ram 1500, but to stay under $25,000, you'll generally be looking at the 3.6-liter V6 with 305 horsepower. This engine was mated with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The Ram 1500 is a big truck with a 140.5-inch wheelbase and 229 inches of overall length. The truck bed allows for 50 cubic feet of storage, and a properly equipped truck can tow up to 7,480 pounds. The Ram 1500 for this model year generally enjoyed good crash ratings from the NHTSA and IIHS.\n\n[See Ram 1500 Listings](https://www.autolist.com/ram-ram+pickup+1500#price_min=15000&price_max=25000&radius=500)\n\n### 11. Chevrolet Colorado\n\n![chevrolet-colorado](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4gByTds6f13IO2RMpAqK1p/3b45c10f01192ad6f36e10bb2a5dd151/chevrolet-colorado.jpg)\n\nThe last truck on this list is Chevy's entry in the midsize market. The Colorado is just a bit smaller than the Silverado, but it offers plenty of options in equipment, plus pretty decent gas mileage at 17 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the highway. Just under $25,000 could get you a 2017 Colorado Crew Cab LT 2WD model. This configuration allows for five passengers in a four-door layout. The Colorado offered both a V6 and four-cylinder in this model year, but to keep the price under $25,000, you'll want to look at the 2.5-liter four-cylinder. It comes paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. The standard equipment on a Colorado is very up to date considering the model year. Some features include a rear camera parking system, six-speaker audio system, and tilt steering wheel. The Colorado generally has good crash ratings by NHTSA and IIHS, although its headlights were rated poorly.\n\n[See Chevrolet Colorado Listings](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-colorado#price_min=15000&price_max=25000&radius=500)",

      "body": "Buying a car in California isn't too different from buying one elsewhere in the U.S. You research the vehicle, take it for a test drive, fill out the paperwork, and pay the fees. As with every state, though, California has some unique laws and procedures for buying a car, such as its smog test and as-is laws. Here's how to buy a car in California the right way.\n\n### Buying a Car in California: The Basics\n\nCalifornia has a lively car culture, so finding a good seller is reasonably straightforward. Los Angeles is a good place to look for cars, as its vast network of suburbs and neighborhoods creates a diverse vehicle market. San Diego, Sacramento, Fresno, Bakersfield and the San Francisco Bay Area also have a rich array of new and used cars for sale. Since the state attracts people from all over the country, you can find just about any rare car in these cities, too.\n\nBefore buying a car, it's best to research it carefully. Check out the car's market value on a vehicle valuation site such as Kelley Blue Book, then plug its Vehicle Identification Number into a vehicle history report site such as Carfax. You can find a car's VIN on the driver's side door or by the window on the driver's side dashboard. Before buying a car, ask the dealer if you can drive it to a private garage for a diagnostic check. Although not all dealers let you do this, many do. Diagnostic checks only cost about $60. The California State Automobile Association provides an online list of mechanics that perform high-quality diagnostic tests in the state.\n\n### Buying a Used Car in California\n\nDealers in California can legally sell vehicles \"as-is.\" Under the as-is law, dealers don't have to repair a car before reselling it or provide a warranty. If a dealer offers to repair a vehicle after the sale, make sure they sign a written agreement so you can hold them to it. Also, the Federal Trade Commission requires dealers to provide a buyer's guide for each vehicle they sell. It details the remaining warranty status and mechanical problems as well as the percentage of repairs the seller has agreed to pay if a warranty claim is invoked.\n\nCalifornia law requires dealers to let you purchase a two-day contract cancellation option for any used vehicle under $40,000, except for RVs, motorcycles and a few other vehicle types. This option doesn't exempt you from restocking and cancellation fees if you return the car, however. And the vehicle must be returned in its purchase condition with fewer than 250 extra miles on the odometer. California's cancellation option even offers a refund for any fees, taxes and deposits you paid when buying the car. The dealer must also send you a written explanation if they decline to take back the vehicle. Keep in mind that restocking and cancellation fees depend on the vehicle's price. The California Department of Motor Vehicles offers an online comparison of vehicle fees and price ranges in the state. \n\nThere is also buying a vehicle from a private seller. That may cut down on the middle man if you're not a fan of showrooms.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### How to Pay Fees and Fill Out Paperwork When Buying a Car in California\n\nWhen buying a car in California, you typically have to fill out a lot of paperwork and send it all to the DMV. That includes the bill of sale, registration, vehicle title and application and smog certificate. You may also have to provide loan documents if you took out a loan to buy the car. Notice of ownership transfer and a release of liability is required if you purchased the vehicle used. \n\nFor 2019, California's statewide sales tax on both used and new cars is 7.25 percent, though city and county taxes can be higher. If you bought a car in another county from where you live, online tools such as the California Board of Equalization tool can help you calculate the sales tax you must pay.\n\nAlso, you must pay a title transfer fee of $15 within 30 days of buying a used car. If the vehicle is new, you must pay a $21 title fee instead, also known as a pink slip fee. Car registration in California costs $58, and you can't get a vehicle title if you don't pay this fee. Other fees you may have to pay when buying a car in California include a $25 California Highway Patrol fee, a $1 reflectorized license plate fee, a $1 fingerprint ID fee, a $6 air quality management district fee, a $1 crime deterrence program fee and a $8 smog transfer fee. Smog transfer fees are only necessary if your car is four model years old or younger. Usually, you must also pay a vehicle license fee that's 0.65 percent of the vehicle's value. In California, a zero-emissions parking sticker costs $17, and documentation fees cost $80 plus a little extra for each transaction filing. The California Civil Code requires dealers to list all fees they charge.\n\n### How to Register and Insure Your Car in California\n\nWhen registering your car in California, you must get a certificate of ownership from the seller indicating that you own the vehicle. The seller must also give you a smog test certification for the car. For car buyers' convenience, most dealerships take care of the registration process on their own, and they may even cover registration fees on rare occasions. When buying from a private seller, though, you must typically register the car at the DMV in person. The DMV then gives you a temporary registration slip while processing your official registration. If you don't register your vehicle within 10 days of buying it, you may have to pay late fees. You should also bring your odometer mileage to the DMV if your car is more than 10 years old. You must renew your registration every year. The California DMV sends renewal notices by mail to warn you when your registration is about to expire. You can renew your registration online, in person, by mail or by phone.\n\nCalifornia requires car owners to purchase car insurance. Insurance rates depend on many factors, including the auto insurance company and the price of the car. Rates also depend on the type of car you buy. For example, SUVs and trucks tend to have higher insurance rates than family cars. You can work out such rates with an insurance agent after buying your vehicle.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Special Laws to Follow When Buying a Car in California\n\nCalifornia has a few state-specific laws you should keep in mind when car buying. Under the state's Lemon Law, for example, a new car under a manufacturer's warranty is entitled to a reasonable number of repairs by the manufacturer or its representatives. Otherwise, the manufacturer must refund the purchase or replace the vehicle, and the buyer can choose either option. This law helps prevent the sale of lemons⁠—that is, cars with significant manufacturing defects. Manufacturers that sell lemons must also pay any license fees, registration fees, sales taxes and repair fees the buyer incurred from towing or repairing the vehicle. If your vehicle is determined to be a lemon, also consider lodging a complaint against the manufacturer and dealership with the Better Business Bureau.\n\nAlso, dealers must make sure that any cars they sell have passed the smog test 90 days before ownership transfer. Smog tests involve a licensed technician using equipment to detect how much oxygen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide the car emits as well as how many hydrocarbons it pumps out. Some emissions tests also measure nitrogen. The technician does a visual and functional inspection of the vehicle as well before sending all the emissions data to the Bureau of Automotive Repair. Private sellers aren't required to give their vehicles smog tests before selling them, so you may have to pay hundreds of dollars in repairs to make the vehicle meet emissions standards. The BAR has an online database of each vehicle's smog history. Just plug in your license plate number to find it. If a car you want to buy has passed every smog test, it's probably acceptable to drive.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\nThere are many other factors to consider when buying a car in the Golden State. For example, the purchase price for your new vehicle may have advertising fees rolled into it. These are fees that the dealer relies upon to pay for advertising. Hiding these fees is against the law, and you can often get them removed during negotiation. Another factor to consider is California's laws on bringing in cars from out of state. Registering out-of-state vehicles in California can be expensive due to the state's high emissions standards and smog test requirements. The California DMV site has plenty of specific registration advice for car owners crossing across state lines. \n\nFinally, you should consider the range of titles available for cars in California before you buy one. The state has plenty of salvage titles, for example. These are cars deemed a total loss by insurance companies due to their history of damage. Although insuring salvage titles for more than liability coverage is tricky, since they've often undergone repairs that can resolve problems, they might be a bargain. Some additional vehicle titles available in California are bonded, junk and affidavit titles, among others. Still, these vehicles are best for more car-savvy buyers.\n\nBuying a car in California can be daunting due to the state's wide range of laws, smog tests, as-is sales and contract cancellations, but these laws are designed to protect buyers. As long as you come to the dealer prepared, buying a car in California shouldn't be a hassle.",
